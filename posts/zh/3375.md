instead of traditional seedling from seeds, we are trying to grow roots in water and coconut peat bases from fresh oregano plant (stems with leaves). after 1 week, more than 50% oregano has grown its own roots.  
  
 finding:  
  
 - oregano grows taller with more leaves in coconut peat than in water,but with less and smaller roots  
  
 - in the same water base, oregano grows more and roots with lightening compares to those under sunlight.
