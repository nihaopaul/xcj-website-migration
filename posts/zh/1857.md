Alex update on the progress of the new Botmill 3d printer: 

> I was working on the 3d printer with Mike last Saturday and the parts for the frame, Z and Y axes are almost ready and calibrated.
> 
> We are missing some parts to assemble the motors and the head. And the X axis is still work in progress.  

  
It's a bit strange that Botmill would sell kits with missing parts. Some of the reprap parts are low quality (misprinted gears)and you have to be extra careful tightening nuts as I've accidentally cracked the extruder carriage.

Work on this will continue on Wednesday evening at the space; feel free to help out!
