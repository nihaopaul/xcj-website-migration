The creative programming meeting aims to bring together everybody who is interested in programming. In the first meeting we hope to find the tools to use to gather our knowledge to be able to realize together a project. All participants will have an opportunity to give a brief description of their idea (and occasionally we will breakout into smaller groups based on shared interests) In previews discussions people expressed their interest in Visualising data with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/):[![](http://d3js.org/ex/chord.png)](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/chord.html)Or highlighted the simplisity of [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/):[![](http://paperjs.org/examples/chain/resources/Chain.gif?v=f261825504afceedab50d8ddc8425b4c)](http://paperjs.org/examples/chain/)It seems to be easy to connect javascript to everything which understands [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) in [one](https://github.com/jleben/quickcollider) or [another](https://github.com/crucialfelix/supercolliderjs) way:![](https://github.com/jleben/quickcollider/raw/master/demo/images/gui_screenshot.png)or we do something totally different:![](http://bluegene8210.is-developer.com/user_files/bluegene8210/Image/CSA.png)
