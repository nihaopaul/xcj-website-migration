It's still got warts but I'm personally pretty happy with the results... You can see the PDF [here](https://docs.google.com/open? id=0B-PYJiOSewXLNGU2YTE4MWMtZTc5OC00 NWM4LTk3ZGMtYmNhZGZmZTkzY2U0).

40 pages in less than 72 hours is a big achievement and it's truly been a global effort and a nice example of inter-hackerspaces collaboration. Huei Ming Tan (who did the bulk of the writing!) and Eddie Choo from Ground Up Initiative in Singapore (http://groundupinitiative.org/) with a lot of incredibly valuable and numerous feedback from Paul Szymkowiak and friends from Connected Community Hackerspace (http://hackmelbourne.org) in Australia and Jerry Isdale from Maui Makers (http://mauimakers.com) plus many others leaving comments here and elsewhere.

Thanks in particular to Paul and Jerry who made it possible for the document to go from mediocre to passable!

And a big, big thanks to Justin Myers from HacDC in Washington DC (http://www.hacdc.org/) who hand-delivered the document at the DARPA office in Arlington as you can see in the attachment...

When you think about it, this is hackers from 4.5 countries (China, Singapore, Australia, US and honestly, Maui, Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific so far away from the continental US) collaborating together. I think whether or not we get the grant (and we should, as I'm convinced Hackerspaces are the only viable option for 100YSS) this is awesome!

Now we have to wait to see who gets selected for the half a million dollars grant... If and when this happens, the initial caretakers will create the 100YSS nonprofit and a charter. Interested Hackerspaces representatives (one per Hackerspace) will be voted in the organization. These representative will then select staff members from candidates for the first 3 months (renewable), gather project proposals and start funding each one by one.
