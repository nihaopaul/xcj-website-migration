The creative programming meeting aims to bring together everybody who is interested in programming. In the "First Creative Programming Meeting" we discussed the meaning of creativity in relation to programming. Two ideas appeared, on the one hand creativity in the finding of solutions for problems and on the other hand using programming for creative "aesthetic products" (art, music, design). Easer of this ideas appeals to you, you might find somebody in the group. Format for the now starting "Weekly Creative Programming Meeting" on Monday evenings, is 'present a problem' and 'retrieve different solutions'. Each week a few people can bring their current projects and explain their problems, when the problem "activates" some creativity of the participants it might develop into a "creative" solution finding group. Feel free to invent a problem and bring it to xinchejian on monday evenings!

**Time:** Mondays at 7PM

**Location:** Xinchejian – 1035 Changle Lu, 2nd floor, Near Wulumuqi Lu
