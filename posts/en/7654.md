This class serial is for people who want to learn how to design AVR8.
The PCB design software going to use is eagle.
Classes will start with design Arduino Uno, then students will design a simple Micro controller by themsleves.
After that, they are also going to learn how to make a bootloader.
The classes serial will take 3 Saturday afternoons, each time will be 3 hours around.
Please prepare: laptop with eagle（http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/freeware/）and Arduino IDE1.6.5（https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software）installed.
