After working at XinCheJian for about 2 weeks, I've gained valuable experience in both work ethics as well as making working with basic hardware. Under the encouragement of my friend, William Kim, I started working at XinCheJian a while ago. Working as an intern, I had the chance to work with some electrical components I would have never came across as a high school student. I also started to learn Arduino and made a simple project out of the junk William and I had sorted out. Throughout the internship, I took great pleasure in meeting new people and talking to them about different things. This gave me an opportunity to broaden my horizons about the technological industry, which is the field I would like to work in after my undergraduate studies. I thank everyone at XinCheJian who has helped me with any problems I came across, but I want to especially thank Ricky. Ricky made sure I made good use of my time by assigning tasks and certain goals to reach by the end of the internship. He also suggested me to present on Wednesday Open Night, which is something I would never have thought to do without him. I will definitely return often to XinCheJian, but for now, I will have to be occupied by college applications... ÔºçKevin Yu
