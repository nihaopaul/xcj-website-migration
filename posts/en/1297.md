XinCheJian participated in a panel and discussion last Sunday at XinDanWei. Liu Yan, Chen Xu from XinDanwei Ricky Ng-Adam, Min Lin Hsieh from XinCheJian Tony Bacigulapo, "Mayor" of New Work City, New York The Future is Co Notes from the moderator, An Xiao are available. Quotes: At a hacker space like Xinchejian, this might mean bringing in hackers of different kinds, from software programmers to roboticists to urban farmers. The point is to find that magic spark of synergy that a more homogenous group wouldn’t be able to provide.
