This is the third design of structure to support flogger to float in the nutrient water for the aeroponic box. This is smallest one so far to allow the bottom half of the plant roots to submerge in the water to maximize the water uptake while allowing the top half of roots to be in the mist of nutrient for efficient nutrient intake.
