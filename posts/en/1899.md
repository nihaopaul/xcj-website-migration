The drinks are a bit pricey and it’s only one arcade cabinet right now, but we obviously love the idea of an arcade-themed bar! The games are from the Winnitron Indie Game Arcade Network – you may remember the talk last Wednesday at XinCheJian by Bryan Ma. We particularly liked Paper Moon from Infinite Ammo although it’s a single player game.

Arcade: 57 Fuxing east road (corner Yongfu road) in Shanghai.

We’re definitely due for a resurgence of arcades… At XCJ, Lio is helping doing our part by building our own game cabinet (based on Commodore 64 games).
