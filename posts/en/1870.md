Today was the Wednesday meeting.  A whale man, a whale man from imlab, came to the new workshop. He is one of the first people in China to use Arduino and apply it to the art field.  The whale man came to the new workshop to introduce his previous interesting work and shared his experiences during his study in Japan. Finally, he introduced the future work of imlab, and he and his team will design to improve existing life, conduct prototype development, and ultimately benefit the public. The whale man and his team will be conducting research in Shanghai recently and participate in various activities. Imlab will participate in a series of activities and may visit the open-source hardware manufacturer DFRobot next week to communicate and exchange ideas.

Next, Bryan introduced open-source independent game development and invited everyone to experience it on site.

After the meeting, everyone interacted and exchanged information separately about their concerns.

Edward demonstrated how to make circuit boards manually.

Alex continued to install reprap, and next month, rockets will bring chocolate to experiment with the possibility of a "chocolate printer."
