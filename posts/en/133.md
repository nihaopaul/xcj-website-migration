[gallery] One of the big challenge of building robots is to come up with good electromechanical designs. [Google Sketchup] (now at version 8 ) is free and, as far as 3D software go, very easy-to-use with many features permitting coming up with useful plans for your next robot. Most useful for the 3D-challenged however is the [3D Warehouse] with user-contributed models. You can, for example, find a model of the [Arduino Dueminalove] and a range of sensors (such as the [Parallax Ping] or the [Sharp IR sensor]) in addition to parts such as [servomotor] and [RC chassis]. These can be directly inserted into your design by simply going to File > 3D Warehouse > Get Models. The downside is that you'll need to buy the [pricey pro version] (500$USD) to get the export features - which will be handy when you when to get your mechanical parts produced. But if you're a member and working on a fun project, feel free to ask me to export your model to one of the [many formats available]. (Disclosure: I work for the company that makes Sketchup, however I don't currently have any relationship with the team.)
