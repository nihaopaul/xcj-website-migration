This is a photo of the finished product.  It's been a year's work and many trials to get this thing in the air.  It's finally flown!  The craft is a bit ugly, but bear with it. 

The airframe is low-cost, intended for flight. The quadcopter frame was made with PVC pipes and a water tank. 

Two batteries, KK flight controller, four new 1000kv motors, and four 30A ESCs were used.  Here's a close-up of the control components.
