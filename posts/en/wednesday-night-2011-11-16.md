Today was Wednesday's meeting.  Whale Man, from imlab, joined the new workshop.  He is one of the first in China to use Arduino and apply it to art.  Whale Man presented his previous interesting work at the new workshop and shared his experiences during his studies in Japan.  Finally, he introduced imlab's future work, which involves designing and prototyping to improve existing lives, ultimately benefiting the public.  Whale Man and his team will be conducting research in Shanghai soon, participating in various activities.  imlab will participate in a series of activities and may visit the open-source hardware manufacturer DFRobot next week for communication and exchange.  Then Bryan introduced open independent game development games and invited everyone to experience them on-site.  After the meeting, everyone interacted and exchanged information separately about their concerns.  Edward demonstrated how to manually manufacture circuit boards.  Alex continued installing reprap. Next month, rockets will bring chocolate to experiment with the possibility of a "chocolate printer."
