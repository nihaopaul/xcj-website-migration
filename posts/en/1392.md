Inspired by [this post](http://hackaday.com/2011/08/11/how-to-put-your-logo-in-a-qr-code/) on Hack A Day, I've decided to make one with XinCheJian's logo. I've tried a few different free online QR code generators, only [this one](http://www.mobilefish.com/services/qrcode/qrcode.php) so far can generate correct QR codes with Chinese characters. After generating the QR code with the message I want, I've opened it in Photoshop, added an overlay of XinCheJian's logo on top, done some manipulation to remove overlapped areas of the QR code, and saved it again. Voila!
