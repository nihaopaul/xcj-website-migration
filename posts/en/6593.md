The Arduino workshop is great for those looking to get started with micro-controller programming and need a kickstart in the right direction. This is one of the most popular workshops at XinCheJian, designed to not overwhelm people but provide the right balance of theoretical and hands-on experience. Please do not sign up if you are not going to show up, as you'll be taking a seat from someone who wants to do it. This workshop will be conducted in English. You will need your own Arduino kit; we have kits available at XinCheJian for RMB 210.00. You can order online from DFRobot or purchase from us to support the space. Workshop content: * Introduction to Arduino: board, IDE * Writing your first program * Connecting to sensors and hardware * Discussion and Q&A. Notes: Please bring a laptop with the Arduino environment installed.
