We haven't been very good about posting blog posts, but the weeks since the Roboracing competition on July 11th have been as busy as ever! Our members are all doing great things and the Weekly Wednesday Meetup has been key in offering an outlet for those who can't join us on the weekend. As an example, tonight, we welcomed Andria Payne from [CET Academic Programs](http://www.cetacademicprograms.com/), the same program that found us our fantastic summer intern [Jonathan Kalin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-kalin/20/44a/478) to XinCheJian. We had the pleasure to have a new paying member join us: Scott, who's been very active in the urban farming project. We also welcomed a new visitor (Severin, originally from Germany) who immediately got to work helping Michael assembling a new CNC mill and trying to repair the broken [Apple Time Capsule](http://timecapsuledead.org/) that Scott brought in (with some impressive capacitors sparks!). All this in the middle of a very busy evening with Paul fixing the Internet access (a simple re-crimp on the RJ45 cable did the trick), soldering together ultra-bright LEDs for the interactive plant project and taking apart the bubble jet printer with Michael. In the meantime, Lio whipped up a converter from 12V to 6V for the alarm battery (with a homemade heatsink) and figured out the rookie mistake that Ricky made preventing him from controlling the servos with the Freescale XL Star board (note to self: all grounds need to be connected to each other!). Ricky also helped out with Fan's piano-driven RGB LEDs project MCU software. Lili was also in the space to promote her [Bee Housing project (codename: Goldendust)](http://xinchejian.com/2011/08/03/goldendust-pollination-impact/). Of note also is the successful daytrip to the Beijing road electronics market where Nelson bought the components for [this weekend H-Bridge soldering extravaganza](http://xinchejian.com/?page%5Fid=548Â®event%5Faction=register&event%5Fid=39&name%5Fof%5Fevent=Roboracing%20Workshop).[See you next week](http://xinchejian.com/event)!
