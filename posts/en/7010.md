Fee: 300RMB; XinCheJian members enjoy reduced fee at 200RMB. Learn the basics of designing your own PCB, you can use free tools such as EagleCAD (freemium) or KiCad (opensource). For this, we'll use EagleCAD. First, learn how to layout schematics, then move into the layout tool and design your first PCB. We will design and layout our own microcontroller called "Annoying ATTron" using the ATTiny85, which is compatible with the Arduino Core with a few addons, but only has 6 pins and no external crystal needed. We'll also use autorouting for quick routing; if you prefer hand-routing, you can do that after the workshop. We'll use 0805 SMD components as much as possible to avoid drilling holes. What you need to prepare: 1. Download EagleCAD and activate the freemium version: www.cadsoft.de/freeware.htm 2. Bring your computer. The Workshop: The workshop will be a 3-hour guided tutorial, ideal for kids and adults with no prior programming or electrical knowledge. The workshop will be in English, led by Paul.
