From next week, non-members will be charged 5 RMB each time they visit. Members who join on the night will get their fee back. Ladies can get a month free by signing up for three months. This month marks the 2nd anniversary of XinCheJian, and a party is planned for the 26th.  Everyone is needed to help with the party, especially a 50-person cake.  A robot race is scheduled for April 6th from 2pm to 5pm. Make+ is inviting new members, and you can email them for more details. On Wednesday, there will be two demonstrations of impressive but delicate projects. The Daedalus City project, a fascinating project from within XinCheJian, will be demonstrated with robots, lights, and cameras.
