Time: Dec. 28 Sunday, 1:30pm - 3:30pm. Location: XinCheJian Please bring your computer, and a plant if you have one. Due to limited supply, each Edison board will be shared by two people! The Intel Edison development platform is the first in a series of low-cost, product-ready, general purpose compute platforms that help lower the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs of all sizes—from pro makers to consumer electronics and companies working in the Internet of Things (IoT). The Intel Edison development platform packs a robust set of features into its small size, delivering great performance, durability, and a broad spectrum of I/O and software support. Those versatile features help meet the needs of a wide range of customers. Angelo, engineer from DFrobot, is greatly inspired by this new development board and would like to share the experience with more makers at XinCheJian hackerspace. The 'cloud' soil project that will be shared at the workshop will use temperature and humidity sensors, LCD modules, and sensor extension boards. This workshop is for those with Arduino or raspberry pi programming experience, having knowledge of C language or any software development experience, or just interested in Intel Edison.
