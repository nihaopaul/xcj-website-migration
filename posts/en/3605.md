**Wednesday Presenters:**

* **Richard Summers:**  Richard Summers, from W+K, aspires to live near the ocean, away from the crowds.  He'll be discussing past, present, and future projects, aiming to blur the lines between reality and virtual reality.  Projects include:
    * Large-scale pinhole photography
    * Photosynthesized Easter eggs (a recent initiative)
    * Project "High Tide"

* **Freda:** Freda will discuss an initiative addressing pet issues.  Many people view pets as a temporary interest, not a lifelong commitment.  She aims to tackle pet abandonment and mistreatment, and is seeking ideas from the community.
    * Pet Abandonment Project
