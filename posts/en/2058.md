Makers and Breakers, hello again from XinCheJian. It's Wednesday already, we're at it again! Time to get off the couch or out of the rain and come hang out with us at XinCheJian and make stuff.

**Tonight's topics:** We should have three interesting topics tonight: Farming in an Urban window, presented by Jeff; followed by the 8x8x8 cube (you might have seen it on the mailing list).  If anyone knows, the 8x8x8 cube requires significant multiplexing—let's find out how many pins that guy used!  Raven will also kick things off with a processing introduction for anyone interested in signing up for the processing workshop.

**Important Notice:** XinCheJian is run by volunteers.  Donations of time, toys, or money are crucial for the space to continue operating. If you're interested in joining the team, we have volunteer or internship positions open!  If volunteering isn't an option, consider buying a drink from the fridge or even some kits—every little bit helps.

**What's happening this week at XinCheJian?**

* **Thursday:** 7 PM - Embedded engineers event in Chinese, led by Shen Jie, with pizza!
* **Friday:** 7 PM - Habib from MakeSense Social Enterprises & companies meetup
* **Saturday:** 3 PM - Shyul Lee's introduction to FPGA and ARM. <http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=82>
* **Sunday:** 2:30 PM - Insectbot workshop by David and Lutz. A great workshop for getting started with Arduino and experiencing the hackerspace! Highly entertaining, safe for all ages.  "The Insect bot workshop got me started at XinCheJian back in May, confused and disoriented about a hackerspace—this put me on the right path to making great things!" – Paul.
