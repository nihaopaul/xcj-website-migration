It's always good to make stuff, nothing beats the self accomplishment of making something and finishing it, if you make bits n bytes all day, come and make bits n bobs. This week at XinCheJian we have something for everyone. He QiChen dubbed the "Mitch Altman of China" is a young creative entrepreneur with a very bright future. His latest idea is called Toy Story (云端漫步) which has got him noticed at the latest startup weekend. Learn more tonight as He QiChen presents his Vision. Also going on tonight is a Christmas team, tonight is brainstorming. Some interesting things are already coming up on the mailing list so come and make something you can be proud of and share with others to make this December one of a kind. If this doesn't do it for you, this Sunday is robo-racing weekend, a great time to make your robot or modify it to race better is tonight.
