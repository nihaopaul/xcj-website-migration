# [RoboPeak Team](http://www.robopeak.com/)

We are very happy to be able to invite this Shanghai based Robot team. I ran into them on Weibo and thought they were professional team. Only when we meet, I learn that they are also a group of robot hobbyist. Wow! That's some bar they set up for robot hobbyist! We gotta keep up!

There are a lot of information about their work on [their web site.](http://www.robopeak.com/) We post the faces behind the team and look forward to meeting them again.
