1. Who are you? Lionello Lunesu, but please call me Lio.
2. What do you do? I'm a Tech Lead at Microsoft China.
3. What inspires you? People making stuff.
4. What attracts you to the space/what do you like about the space? Everything you could possibly need to realize your idea is there, no more excuses.
5. What do you want to do/accomplish/learn/share/experience? Being a programmer I'm making stuff all day, but nothing beats working with real materials.
6. If there is only one thing you could share with people, what would it be? I'd like everyone to know that finishing a project, no matter how insignificant it seems, results in a high, and it will make you go back for more.
7. Tell us a secret.. one you haven’t told anyone else? Uh, see the answer to the next question:
8. Who’s your idol? I'm going to sound like a nerd, but Bill Gates inspires me. He's a geek with business skills and his heart is in the right place.
9. Where would you rate yourself on a geeky slider? (or nerdy if you are that way) From 0 (Queen Elizabeth) to 10 (übergeek), I'm probably around an 8: pretty geeky yet not unsociable (.. I hope!)
