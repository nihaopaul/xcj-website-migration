At Shanghai’s Pudong Century Park on Saturday. Big thanks to Paul, Edward and Rockets for waking up early (7am!), setting up and manning the booth (with Lio joining in later in the afternoon). Our half-booth was generously offered by Richard Hsu. The event was intended to showcase Shanghai young creatives in Shanghai. We brought a few projects but the two biggest hits were the DFRobot mobile robot by Rockets and the “useless” (but funny) machine by Edward. There was a big fashion show, many interesting booths and our neighbors had these awesome bamboo bicycles (they’ve since asked us to help out with the electronics).
