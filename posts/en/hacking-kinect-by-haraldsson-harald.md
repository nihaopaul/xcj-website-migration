Visualize World Bank Data with Kinect by Harald Haraldsson
There are over 50 people attending the [grand opening of XinCheJian.](http://xinchejian.com/event/?regevent%5Faction=register&event%5Fid=2&name%5Fof%5Fevent=XinCheJianGrandOpening) The first talk of the events was given by Harald Haraldsson of [Wonwei](http://wonwei.com) about hacking Kinect. Harald is one of the most talented interactive hacker in Shanghai. Make sure to see the light painting with Kinect at the bottom of this post.

## Getting Ready

## Light Painting with Kinect and Projector
This is amazing project by Harald. Those of us into photographers have play around with light painting but Harald's hack took it to the next step. Kinect can detect depth of an object before it. By using a piece of flat surface with projected images on it from projector, the Kinect is used to changed the images projected depending on the depth of the surface. With a camera shooting at long exposure mode, it created a 3D hologram like images. Harald show photos for data visualization.

## Visualization of World Bank Data
Here are a few more pictures provided by Harald. He used the light painting to visualize economic indicator data from World Bank.
