Tired of playing with Arduino and want to up the game? Join XinCheJian Raspberry Meetup to do some cool and complicated stuff. The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used all over the world to learn how computers work, how to manipulate the electronic world around them, and how to program.
