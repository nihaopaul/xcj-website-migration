In [OpenSourceCamp Shanghai](http://groups.google.com/group/opensourcecamp-shanghai), there was a fascinating discussion about open source and knock-offs, and [Wang Jiangchuan](besttone.com.cn) wrote this quite interesting article. --- In the past couple of days, I've seen everyone in the forum getting very heated, with some novel words popping up from time to time, such as cloud computing, Innovation Factory, and open source business models, and yet it seems that a very old-fashioned word—'knock-off'—keeps popping up every now and then. I've been immersed in this word 'knock-off' for a long time, and today I took some time to think and sort things out. What exactly is a 'knock-off'? From initial interest, to firsthand experience, and finally to enlightenment, I have a clearer understanding that knock-offs are fundamentally a representation of the natural world's innovative spirit and culture. Chinese people are certainly very good at inventing various flowery phrases. At first glance, the word 'knock-off' directly brings to mind the 108 heroes of Liangshan. Upon closer examination, this is surprisingly precise and ingenious, and the reason is that this is actually one thing. Previously, I saw a program on the Discovery Channel. It was about a group of daring scientists who, after going through life-threatening experiences, made some discoveries while investigating the Congo River. They found many different types of fish in the Congo River that were previously unknown to humans, some of which may be new species. I saw those bizarre-shaped fish, the huge and ferocious tiger fish, the tiny fish that are no bigger than a finger, cannot see, and die as soon as they are taken out of the water, and a fish with a nose like an elephant's trunk. In short, they are strange and bizarre, like creatures from another planet. The scientists seemed very excited because they had discovered a new gene pool. They made a scientific analysis of this strange phenomenon: the Congo River may be the deepest river in the world, with one place reaching a depth of 230 meters, and its depth and water flow patterns are constantly changing, creating many isolated areas. The fast currents and powerful rapids have created natural barriers that small fish cannot cross, and this is precisely the breeding ground for fish diversity. Thus, after millions of years of evolution in isolation, the Congo River has become a species factory in the real world. In fact, if you think about it, any culture, ethnicity, or species distributed in different geographical locations around the globe, or any innovative thing that is different from other things, needs a system that is relatively isolated, whether geographically, culturally, or virtually, while still maintaining various exchanges with the outside world. Look at the rugged mountains and rapids in southwest China's western regions. They have created a rich variety of plant life, diverse animal species, and even diverse ethnic groups. If I were to name these isolated systems, I would call them 'knock-offs'. Still taking the heroes of Liangshan as an example, whether they were establishing their ideal Peach Blossom Land by occupying the mountain, or were forced into a corner by social exclusion and had no other choice, I believe that in fact, they were creating a 'knock-off' for themselves under circumstances they didn't fully understand, hoisting the banner of 'upholding justice for heaven', and turning those who originally robbed and plundered, or sold human flesh dumplings, into seemingly legitimate businesses. In other words, the original pirated goods are in the process of proving their legitimacy as genuine goods. It is undeniable that if Liangshan could continue to improve itself, constantly refine its practices, and accomplish some great feats, it could eventually achieve success and, if nothing else, possibly create a Liangshan dynasty. At the very least, look at Australia. Those exiled criminals thrived and, within a few centuries, built a prosperous nation. From a certain perspective, the heroes of Liangshan, united by their common characteristics, created an innovative 'knock-off' atmosphere. This inadvertently or intentionally established 'knock-off' area is essentially no different from the large and small 'knock-offs' naturally formed in the turbulent currents of the Congo River or the Himalayas. The sad thing about the ideal of a 'knock-off' is that it cannot help but reproach and question itself: 'Am I really the destined one?' and eventually ask itself secretly: 'Am I really worth anything?' This also caused numerous discussions about 'knock-offs' in our forum.
