The simplest form of hydroponic consist of following components that are wildly available around town. - a bucket - 9 yuan - a drain basket - 1 yuan - a dual water and air pump - 30 yuan  

We found ours at friendly neighbor stores near the space.  

The pipes from the pump are fixed on the basket with cable tie. It's fixed in this way to provide water upward.  

Soldering iron is good at making holes on the pipe. I tried simply punching the holes with screw driver but they are uneven. Soldering iron works much better.  

Once the pipe is fixed, put a layer of ceramic balls and transplant the seedlings.
