A few of us have gotten together to organize a Robo race on the 16th of December 2012 at 1pm, we're racing autonomous, it's purely for fun but also bragging rights for the end of the season. If you would like to join us to race (you can be a spectator but its more fun to join in) then sign up for the event, to enter Autonomous racing you'll need to drop 100rmb into the robo racing box, the ultimate winner will take the winnings, if there is no winner, then the money goes into XinCheJian's donation box. We're doing it for fun with a little incentive. If you would like to race a line follower please sign up, there is no prizes for that category and is free to enter (for now, but if you want an incentive then we can put an entry fee on this). Who knows, there might not be a robo racing season next year, so build and join in!**1**: autonomous course - entry 100rmb winner takes all<http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/RoboRacing> (Challenge track)**2**: line follower - entry ???rmb winner takes all?<http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Analog%5Fline%5Ffollower> <http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/track-201204.pdf> << track Register here: <http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=156>
