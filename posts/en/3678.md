It's almost a month since I set up the aquaponic system in Gubei. I've learned a lot about this amazing technology and made a few mistakes. But now, the plants are growing and the fish are swimming! The system now has 5 grown carp and 10 tilapia fingerlings, and the water is in good cycles with 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite, and a good amount of nitrate for the plants.  This is becoming a stable aquaponic system. Now, I just have to wait for the seedlings to be ready to transplant and get a few more fish fingerlings.
