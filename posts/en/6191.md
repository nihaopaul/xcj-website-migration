Machine room training at Xinchejian on March 15th, Saturday, starting 1pm. For members who don't know how to handle the tools safely and correctly, this is your chance to learn to operate the tools in the right way and to protect yourself from getting injured. We've got some dangerous tools there in the machine room. You don't want to mishandle these ones. We have invited Niels to give us the training. He will show you how to use the machines one by one. Be prepared to cut and drill and get your hands dirty!
