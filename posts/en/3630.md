Mini Workshop is a short and hand on workshops offered by different projects in XinCheJian to provide new members an introduction to the projects and opportunities to get involved in the projects of interests. The first workshop "starting seedlings for hydroponic" was run by David from Urban Farming Team success this afternoon. Everyone sowed a tray of seedlings in coconut peat with variety of vegetables, including parsley, carrot, tomato, coriander and many others. On next Saturday afternoon, we will hold the 2nd mini workshop and teach you how to set up a small hydroponic system at home.
