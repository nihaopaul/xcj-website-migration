C++ for Beginners
Time：Sunday April 26th， 1pm－3pm This class will be for those with little to no programming experience to start learning the C++ programming language. It will be taught by Sean Purser-Haskell, a former Google engineer and expert C++ programmer. The class will use visual tools in order to better engage students and convey the effects of their programs. The first two-hour session will introduce the Microsoft Visual C++ development environment and then teach basic control flow using integers. Requirements: Must be at least 13 years old, proficient in English, and bring a laptop with Windows 7 or higher installed. Preparation: Students must install Visual C++ Express 2013 on their laptops prior to coming to class.
