XinCheJian is still under construction, but that won't stop us from keeping up with our Wednesday meetup promise. We have two presentations tonight, plus a sneak peek at the new space. 7pm - free @ XinCheJian 2.0, 1035 Changle Rd, 2nd floor - 上海徐汇区长乐路1035号2楼. See a map and directions here: <http://xinchejian.com/contact-us/?lang=zh>. Unfortunately, those hacking tonight won't have all the usual tools available, but we'll still get them out and put them away afterward! 

**Wednesday Presenters:**

James Tichenor, an interaction designer from Rockwell Lab (<http://www.rockwellgroup.com/lab>), just arrived in Shanghai and will present tonight at XinCheJian on some of his innovative projects using electronics and art. Qichen and Rockets will also present their Home Sous Vide machine, hacked together in 20 minutes, along with some egg tasting, which I hear is spectacular!

**Coming Up Soon:**

机器车竞赛 - Roboracing Competition - 2012/04/22 - <http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=110>
Are you ready? Line followers, Autonomous'rs, and remote specialists, join the second race of the year and show us what you've got! The 2012/04 track is on the wiki and demoed at Barcamp: <http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/RoboRacing>

Processing class (English instructions) - 2012/04/28 - <http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=114>
Given the huge success of the Ravens Processing classes in Chinese, he's agreed to teach this class in English! 

**Recent Changes at XinCheJian:**

Membership is now just 100 RMB per month per member. For an additional 200 RMB per month, you can store your projects/items in the space in a box no larger than 50x50x30cm.  You can contribute more as a donation. Failure to pay membership will result in your items becoming a donation to the space. XinCheJian will no longer provide free community parts, instead we'll sell them in sets (e.g., 10 resistors for 1 RMB) to reduce waste and mess. Members have access to the space and tools. Strangers must be accompanied by a member and are responsible for their behavior during their visit.
