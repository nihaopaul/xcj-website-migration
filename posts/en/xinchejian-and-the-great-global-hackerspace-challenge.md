XinCheJian, the first hackerspace in China, is one of 30 hackerspaces globally selected for the Great Global Hackerspace Challenge (GGHC).  The challenge aims to create an impactful electronics project for educational establishments.  Running from March 21st to May 3rd, 2011, projects are judged on reproducibility, global sourcing ease, cost-effectiveness, documentation, educational relevance, and inventiveness.  XinCheJian's project proposal includes a 5900 RMB (US$900) budget for electronic components, provided by element14.com.  All participating hackerspaces receive 10 soldering setups. Top three semi-finalists get over 13,000 RMB (US$2,000) worth of tools, and the grand prize winner receives a Tektronix MSO2024 oscilloscope (over 36,000 RMB/US$5,600). Semi-finalists are also invited to Maker Faire 2011 in California.  XinCheJian's project focuses on teaching elementary school students collaborative problem-solving through an interactive, intelligent educational toy.
