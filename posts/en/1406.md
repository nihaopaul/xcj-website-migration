Severin reports on his progress: Started working on the beckoning cat last night, so I wanted to give you an update about the progress. Took the cat apart, and got as far as attaching the arm to one servo, so it should now be able to move back and forth, like it's traditionally supposed to, just that we can control the motion. Took a whole bunch of pictures and I'll start writing some step-by-step instructions in the next few days. If anyone wants to help me on the project, let me know. More people, more ideas, and a more awesome cat ;)
