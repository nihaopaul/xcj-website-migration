Fusion 360 is a new 3D modelling software for industrial design, mechanical design, 3D printing and CAM, aimed at design enthusiasts, hardware startups and small product design businesses. It is free for students & enthusiasts (non-commercial users), and works on both Mac and Windows. It’s designed to be a ‘cloud-connected’ software, meaning it uses online storage for file saving, and has built-in tools for online project collaboration and sharing. Quickly and easily explore product ideas in Fusion 360. Start by using simple free-form modeling tools to get just the right shape, or take a shortcut and seamlessly pull your existing data into your Fusion 360 project. Engineer and test it for function. Then prepare it for manufacturing by generating tool paths or using the 3D printing utility. Access your projects from your mobile device where you can view designs, see the latest updates, and make notes. Edit your designs from a Mac or PC. There’s no limit to the number or type of machines you have Fusion 360 running on. All your project information, always up to date, securely accessed, virtually anytime, anywhere. 64-bit Windows 7 or newer and 64-bit Mac OS X 10.8 or newer. Please do register online.
