Lutz and Min Lin led the Insectbot workshop yesterday with some help from Paul for soldering the boards and Ricky to program the Arduinos. About 10 parent/kid pair showed up for the workshop each assembling their own robot. The kit has an DFDuino (Arduino Uno from DFRobot) and two servos that will be useful in future projects.![](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0318-300x225.jpg) ![](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0319-300x225.jpg)
