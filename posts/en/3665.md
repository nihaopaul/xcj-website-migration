After weeks of silence, we're restarting the Swarm Bot project this week. We've made progress on test boards and the robot base, including the first infrared beacon design, but other tasks needed attention. Now's the time to start fresh and complete the project successfully. Our goal is to enter maybe two competitions (details to follow). If you're interested in joining the team, become a member. Team membership is free.  Don't feel you need to be an expert; no one on the team is yet!  Just contribute what you can. Check the progress on the Wiki: <http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Swarm%5Frobots>.
