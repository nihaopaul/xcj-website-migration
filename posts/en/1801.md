Michael has brought all the parts to assemble a reprap. We just have to follow the assembly instructions for the Mendel model with the parts bought from BotMill. Alex has taken the lead on assembling with and has gotten to the point of assembling the outer frame with the help of Min Lin. Anyone else interested by 3d printing is invited to join in. We will work on it both this evening (Monday November 7th) and Wednesday evening (November 9th). Instructionals videos are available onlineâ€¦
