Michael brought all the parts to assemble a RepRap. We just need to follow the assembly instructions for the Mendel model using parts bought from BotMill. Alex is leading the assembly and has gotten to the point of assembling the outer frame with the help of Min Lin.  Anyone else interested in 3D printing is welcome to join. We'll work on it tonight (Monday, November 7th) and Wednesday evening (November 9th). Instructional videos are available online.
