A few days ago Michael sent out this update about the 3D Printer:

> Sorry for the lack of updates on the 3D printer. The white ABS [Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene; a thermoplastic] is horrible. Use the grey PLA [polylactide; thermoplastic aliphatic polyester] from now on. I reinstalled the old nozzle (made a new one and promptly burned it out the same day) and was able to print without making any changes. It actually sticks to the platform and to each other. Was able to get 1/3 of the 2cm box before it sheared off. Still have problems with flow control, but happy that it works better. The toothed gear may be too sharp, since it jams up with plastic after a while. Need to clean it out every so often, but it still pulls filament even when jammed. Also started to wrap up the wiring. Iâ€™m going to be out of town for a while, so who ever wants to take over and get it flowing better, be my guest.
