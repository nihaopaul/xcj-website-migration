Last Sunday we had a brilliant workshop at XinCheJian -- the brave robot workshop hosted by Yair Reshef, an artist from Iseral. Yair started the brave robot workshops as the idea of compassion in design and robotics is something he has been dealing with and the workshop is the chance to get it on. The brave robots in this project are the ones without micro-controllers and/or sophisticated programming. The robotic design is purely analog and mechanic based. You can make your brave robot without much electronic knowledge but you need to be creative to make your robot unique and have fun! During the 3 hour workshop, everyone who joined finished their first brave robot. Thanks to the hard work on soldering! Perhaps we could expect a brave robot racing at XinCheJian sometime, why not?
