X-Bot is evolving and now already smart enough to follow another X-Bot. What is so special about that you may ask? Well, there is this small, quite technical-looking robot, and there's a program running in X-Bot's brain (also called a Microcontroller or MCU). To follow another robot means they need to communicate, and this works with infrared signals going from the leader to the follower and back. Leo did the programming and the hardware and is willing to share that with you. Just check this website regularly and see when the next workshop is scheduled. **Build your own X-Bot in Xinchejian!** If you want to support the X-Bot, buy a couple of them, or just help develop it further, then please go to <http://dreamore.cn/Project/Show/512> and see more details there.
