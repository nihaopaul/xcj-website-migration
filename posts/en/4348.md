HAPPY NEW YEAR!! Chinese Spring Festival celebration does not end until Lantern Festival, the 15th day of first lunar month which is 24th Feb. this year. Besides solving puzzles on lanterns, eating glutinous rice balls and enjoying family reunion is a tradition. We'd like to invite you, our XinCheJian family members, join us for the celebration and making rice balls together. Come along at 7pm this Saturday (23rd), bring your appetite and we will take care of the rest ;-) Traditional black sesame, sweetened red bean paste, and salty meat fillings will be available; and you are more than welcome to bring your own secret recipes! We love to have you all, unfortunately due to limited capacity, please kindly RSVP: jiaqi@xinchejian.com; and we can prepare materials and foods accordingly, for maximum 25 people. See ya there! ps: this event is open to xinchejian members only.
