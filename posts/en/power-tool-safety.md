Power tools can be dangerous. Whether its the band saw cutting a finger or that hand held Dremel shooting a plastic shard at your eye, please treat power (and non-power) tools with respect. Don't be afraid to use tools. Attend training classes and practice using the tools. Be aware of safety for yourself and others. If someone is doing something unsafe, ask them to stop. Ask questions if you're unsure. Guidelines for using power tools at Xinchejian:
