I shoot this a while back to promote Hackerspace but never get around to publish it. [Strobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com/) is the tinker of light and the hacker among photographers.

Some strobist setup info here:


- SB-600 inside the makerbot
- SB-800 on shoot-through umbrella to the camera right
