Extra, extra, read all about it! Shanghai's young generation is about to have a blast! XinCheJian is hosting a "Young Makers Open Day"!  This April, XinCheJian's creators traveled to Shenzhen and Beijing, participating in China's first mini-maker faire and maker carnival.  How can our children participate? We've got the answer!  To celebrate Children's Day, XinCheJian will hold a special children's carnival on June 2nd from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.  This "Young Makers Open Day" will showcase all the fun of XinCheJian over the past year.  See the chopsticks robot, the crazy mousetrap, and play with conductive dough.  Marvel at the magic cap line patrol car, experience children's programming software, and check out DFRobot's bomb disposal game, and much more!  Chat with XinCheJian's team and meet like-minded people.  Workshops are also planned: Soldering Workshop and Ultra-light Clay Workshop.  A spaghetti bridge challenge, a classic project fostering teamwork and problem-solving skills, will be a fun competition to participate in. Parents are welcome to join in and learn alongside their children. This event promises fun, education, and exploration for all.
