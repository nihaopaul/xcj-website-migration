_Dear Entrepreneurs and Dream Weavers,_

_I am Shyu Lee, a company starter in Shanghai. I resigned from my previous job and started an electrical design service. It looks Google+ is having an increasing level in my social life, as it recently connected Ricky in my "Circle" and made me know XinCheJian. I feel so excited to know a big group of people here are doing innovative work together, that after visited here last weekend, I decided to do all of my best to cooperate with you guys and realize the wildly new ideas._ _I used to be working for an American company plotting and designing wireless IC products, and I am also good hand on embedded system design. During this Saturday, I am going to come to XinCheJian's space to introduce DS1000E, an ARM+FPGA development platform, with its,_
* _120 MHz, ARM Cortex-M3 based STM32F207 MCU of great power for controlling algorithms!_
* _1MByte On-Chip Flash, unleashes your ideas of programming!_
* _1MByte SRAM and 128MByte records whatever you want to collect!_
* _Altera EP3C16 FPGA awesomely glued with STM32 MCU brings extensive real-time logic and I/O expansion!_
* _4.3'' TFT LCD brings PSP feeling and a geeky keyboard!_
* _DM9000 100Mbps Ethernet connects your system with Internet!_
_I am standing with this development for XinCheJian, answering your questions and helping with your applications!_ _By the meanwhile, I will_ 
* _Donate one of the DS1000E development platform to XinCheJian,_
* _Answer the questions from your guys,_
* _And have a discussion about the applications and projects in XinCheJian._
_For the future time, as I have promised, I will be a volunteer in XinCheJian, start with,_
* _Provide technical consultancy for designs with ARM, FPGA, analog, wireless, motor control and so on,_
* _Help with identifying electrical components, give suggestion on purchasing, and provide discount information,_
* _Actively join in the discussions of XinCheJian, help with the projects and contests,_
