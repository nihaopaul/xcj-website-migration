I used RP5 Tracked Mobile Tank Bas and Arduino DFRduino Duemilanove 328 (Arduino Compatible) Motor Shield. The sensors used are Adjustable Infrared Sensor Switch. A total of three sensors are used. My sensors are placed in the center front, right front, and right center of the tank. The main strategy is to follow the edge. The names in the program are because I thought the competition direction was clockwise before programming, but it was counter-clockwise during the competition, so I didn't have time to change the names. The following is the program. int E1 = 5; int M1 = 4; int E2 = 6; int M2 = 7; // This part is the definition of the motor shield int front = 8; int leftFront = 9; int rightBack = 10; // Sensor definition void setup() { pinMode(M1, OUTPUT); pinMode(M2, OUTPUT); pinMode(front, INPUT); pinMode(leftFront, INPUT); pinMode(rightBack, INPUT); } void forward() { digitalWrite(M1, HIGH); digitalWrite(M2, HIGH); analogWrite(E1, 255); analogWrite(E2, 255); } void backward() { digitalWrite(M1, LOW); digitalWrite(M2, LOW); analogWrite(E1, 255); analogWrite(E2, 255); } void right() { digitalWrite(M1, HIGH); digitalWrite(M2, LOW); analogWrite(E1, 255); analogWrite(E2, 255); } void left() { digitalWrite(M1, LOW); digitalWrite(M2, HIGH); analogWrite(E1, 255); analogWrite(E2, 255); } void loop() { if (digitalRead(leftFront) == HIGH) { right(); delay(600); } else if (digitalRead(front) == HIGH && digitalRead(rightBack) == HIGH) { forward(); delay(500); } else if (digitalRead(front) == LOW && digitalRead(rightBack) == HIGH) { left(); delay(500); } else if (digitalRead(rightBack) == LOW && digitalRead(front)== HIGH) { right(); delay(100); } else { left(); } }  The program above. Please correct and criticize.
