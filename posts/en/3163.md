Whether to support our weekly open house events and the development of new workshops or because you're looking for a nice physical space with an awesome community to work on your cool project, we encourage people to join as members for as low as RMB100 a month. Volunteers (organization, project management, translation, graphic design, etc) can also be recognized for their sustained efforts to support the community with free membership. Please send us a request to be considered a staff member. A special thanks to all past and current volunteers who've made what XinCheJian is today possible! Current members in good standing:
