Learn the basics of designing your own PCB, you can use free tools such as EagleCAD (freemium) or KiCad (opensource). For this workshop, we'll use EagleCAD. First, we'll learn how to layout schematics, then move to the layout tool, and finally design your very first PCB. We'll design and layout our own microcontroller, the "Annoying ATTron", using the ATTiny85, compatible with the Arduino core with a few addons, but only 6 pins to work with and no external crystal needed. We'll use autorouting for fast routing, and if you don't like it, you can hand-route it later. We'll mainly use 0805 SMD components, as drilling holes is tedious. This workshop is ideal for kids and adults with no programming or electrical knowledge. **Time:** July 11th, 2 PM - 5 PM (3 hours). **Language:** Primarily English, with basic Chinese translation provided. **What to prepare:** 1. Download and activate EagleCAD (freemium): www.cadsoft.de/freeware.htm  2. Bring your computer. **Fee:** 300 RMB; XinCheJian members get a discount of 200 RMB.
