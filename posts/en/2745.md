**Simple Analog Line Follower**

One of the easiest way to participate in XinCheJian's next robot racing compeition is to build a simple analog line follower robot.

No programming skill required at all!! You will not only learn some basic knowledge about analog circuits, but also gets to exericse your soldering skills.

With only less than 10 common electronic parts and recycled bottle caps as the wheel, you can construct a very simple line follower, arguably the most simple one ever!

This workshop is suitable for people who are interested in soldering and robotics. Participant must be 10 years or older.
