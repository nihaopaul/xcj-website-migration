rmb200 for non xinchejian members and rmb150 for xinchejian members. Taught by Mitch Altman. This workshop is easy enough for total newbies to learn all you need to know to get going on an Arduino. Participants will use an Arduino clone, and set it up on solderless breadboards to make their own TV-B-Gone remote control to turn off TVs in public places -- a fun way to learn Arduino (and electronics) basics. Bring your laptop, if you can. Bring your Arduino kits or buy one onsite for rmb210.

Itinerary
Intro to Arduino
Very short lesson to learn everything you need to know about electronics!
We will be using an Arduino clone and set up the free and open-source software on our laptops (if you bring one) -- Windows, MacOS, or Linux are all fine!
And then it's time to make something and learn how easy it is to use Arduino!
I'll (very easily!) show you how to read schematic diagrams, and you'll put together your own TV-B-Gone remote control using your Arduino clone.
We will use a solderless breadboard.
These are really useful, and provide a fast, and very easy way to put circuits together without needing to solder.
Target practice is available after the workshop.
