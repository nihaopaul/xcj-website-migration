What's a night hanging out at the pop-up hackerspace in Xu Jia Hui without some long exposure and flash fun! Lumi and David are both long-time Strobist and can't pass the chance to have some fun creating ghost photos while looking after the container.

### How to make ghost photos?

The ghost photos are made with long exposure, in this case, f/20 and 5-second shutter, two flashes (one on the floor and one on the top of the container). The subjects ran into the positions, triggered the flash manually with a remote, and ran out of the frame. The flash froze the subject in place against the long exposure background and appear translucent.
