BarCamp is a fun, user-generated "un-conference" that started in Silicon Valley as a response to formal, exclusive, and boring tech conferences. If you are interested in technology, startups, design, or social innovation, you can't miss this event! BarCamp consists of passionate 15-minute presentations on any topic. Anyone (yes, anyone!) can sign up to present on anything (but please, no advertisements for your company). Just let your own energy and nerdiness shine through. All presentations are followed by time for discussion. You can expect to have amazing discussions on cutting edge technology and trends. The event is free and open to everyone! Go to the [techyizu.org ](http://www.techyizu.org)website for more event details. Shanghai BarCamp is being presented to you by TechYizu, an organization that aims to organize Shanghai's lively startup and tech community. -------------------- Follow us on: Weibo Follow Xinchejian: <http://t.sina.com.cn/xinchejian>Follow Techyizu: <http://t.sina.com.cn/techyizu>Twitter Follow Xinchejian: <http://twitter.com/xinchejian>Follow Techyizu: <http://twitter.com/techyizu>
