Xinchejian is the first hackerspace in Shanghai. It's a space for hackers, tinkers, artists and hobbyists who are interested in playing with physical computing, digital art, robotics and everything connecting the physical worlds to the digital world. Xinchejian has been in operation for a month. We now run an Arduino workshop, have several groups working on different projects such as quadcopters, urban farming rack and etc. We'd like to invite more people interested in doing DIY and like to get their hand dirty to make some magic to join us. We are located at 50 Yongjia Lu.
