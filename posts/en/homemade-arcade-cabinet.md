Lio just finished getting the wood plate for the joysticks and buttons. He's showing off the hacked TV driven by a Commodore 64 to generate a mirror image that can be itself "projected" on a mirror. He still has some work to do to wire everything up and make the case nicer, but the hard part is over. Interesting factoid: the speaker at the right is hiding a broken piece of the mirror!
