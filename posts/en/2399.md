Squishy conductive men and women!! February 26th, 9AM to 12PM will be the first conductive dough workshop, be a god and make a your own male & female dough (conductive and non-conductive) with a simple recipie with your own hands, create a funny conductive "man" doll or "female" doll. The dough recipe is very simple, which uses common everyday materials, flour, salt, vegetable oil, water, and so on. with simple mixing and kneading with a splash of color to make any color. Want to make a squishy circuit? 1) build all kinds of circuits from buzzers to LEDS to motors 2) A safe and easy way for kids to play with dough and experiment with electricity (Low power) 3) Pick and choose the color of the dough to make what ever comes to mind 4) Use the dough with arduino to make some eye popping artistic projects (great for the entire family) 5). . . . . . . . . . . . Welcome children over the age of five and the playful spirit of moms and dads together in this workshop, and our dough carnival :)[![](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/11.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/2012/02/04/squishy-circuit/1-4/) [![](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/21-300x225.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/2012/02/04/squishy-circuit/2-4/) [![](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/41-223x300.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/2012/02/04/squishy-circuit/4-2/) [![](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/33-300x179.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/2012/02/04/squishy-circuit/3-4/)Attribution: Crazy dough (squishy circuit) is the product of the American University of St. Thomas University UST Design Lab AnnMarie P.
