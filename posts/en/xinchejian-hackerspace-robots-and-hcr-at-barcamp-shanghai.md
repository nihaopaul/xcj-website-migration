XinCheJian was at Barcamp Shanghai! We talked about Hackerspace, Maker, Open Source Hardware, and ROBOTS!

The robot car David built the night before with YM4, Arduino Uno, and a HC-SR04.  The independently controlled wheels let it turn but had a problem going straight.  It was a crazy robot, dedicated to the taxi driver who got me there!  

We pitched Hackerspace and Maker Culture.

Rick Ye talked about his open source HCR robot.  It has a camera and automated navigation.  It's great for a caddy!
