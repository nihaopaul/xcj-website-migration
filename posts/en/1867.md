A simple DIY laser microscope. 1. 300 mA laser pointer from Taobao for RMB 51. This thing is powerful and dangerous. Handle carefully! 

2. A small drop of water. I use water from the aeroponic tank. 

3. Aim the laser right through the droplet. Wear dark glasses while aiming and focusing. Even the reflection from this powerful laser can be dangerous! 

4. Awesome laser show with live microbes swimming inside that you can watch for hours!!!
