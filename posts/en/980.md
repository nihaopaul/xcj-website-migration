This is a blog post about the development of an embedded dream car. The author encountered problems with the car moving erratically after power-on. They investigated the issue and found that the car's UNO board had compatibility issues with different operating systems. They solved this by switching to a Mega 1280 board.  The author also encountered issues when using the car's 5V power supply while the Arduino was powered by the USB. The voltage drop from the motors caused instability. To fix this they added a separate 9V battery for the Arduino power supply. They programmed the car for forward motion, with backward motion and turning when an obstacle was detected. The program does not include speed control.  The post contains images of the car.
