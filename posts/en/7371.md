Increasing entropy is a natural state of things, especially in an hackerspace that sees many projects and many contributions. Regular cleaning and sorting is required to get the handle on the chaos. We've collected equipment, parts, components, used equipment without owners into an outgoing pile in the space . If you wish to take ownership of something from that pile for projects purpose, you must either: **take ownership and label it** (name, project, contact info, expiry date) and store it in your storage box (storage box are 30RMB/month) **OR, for shared stuff:** put it on the proper shelve or box that has a category label Work surfaces and space under the tables are **NOT** storage areas. Anything left on the tables, under the tables, without labels or not properly organized will be added to the outgoing pile. Wednesday July 22nd 7pm is the deadline before we start donating to the outside from the pile.
