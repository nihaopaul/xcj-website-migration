Shanghai Jing'an Yuyuan Donglu 28, No. 3 Building, 1st Floor, New Workshop [http://xinchejian.huodongxing.com/event/map/5244063275800] [![0](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/0-290x290.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/0.jpg) [Register to participate](http://www.huodongxing.com/event/3255247748600 "Sign up now") Time: Saturday, November 15th, 10:00 AM. This event will allow enthusiasts to install a legendary-level headphone amplifier, purchasing their own components. Geeks love hands-on activities and music, and we can't do without music. The headphone amplifier will purify your headphones, allowing the music to reach a state of ethereal beauty.  Of course, you are free to choose your preferred components, and we will organize and play together. If you have a good pair of headphones, please bring them to test the amplifier. This amplifier can reach the level of $2000-$4000 headphone amplifiers on the market. Let's witness the miracle. After the amplifier is complete, we can enjoy classical, vocal, and instrumental music, as well as some new-age and slow rock music.  Partners with good audio sources can bring their audio sources to showcase and share the driving force of music. Component purchase price: $200. This event is a free group activity for members. If you need components, please register and pay in advance. Those without components can be bystanders.
