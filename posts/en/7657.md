A chemical engineer from the USA, Mike Sherretz worked in the oil and gas industry for 10 years. His chemical engineering background and ability to relate to others has allowed him to work in many places around the world. Mike is a consultant with TRI Corporation, is co­founder of Leaderstyles International Co., LTD, and ­­ more relevant here ­­ is the founder of My Homebrew Store right here in Shanghai. He made his first batch of beer in 1990, and now he’s a several time bechampion! He’s considered the godfather of beer in China, and XinCheJian is very lucky to have him stopping by. Mike says, “Everybody told me I couldn’t do it. They said that they had heard stories about people making ‘brew’, and it made people sick. So I told people, let me try it and you can say if it’s the same. I’ve been giving away wine and beer ever since with no complaints. Everybody keeps coming back asking for more.” He’s excited to teach others how to make good beer! Come join and learn how you can do it, too!
