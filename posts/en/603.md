# RoboPeak from Shanghai

We are so glad that [RoboPeak](http://www.robopeak.com/), a robotic R&D team has agreed to be one of the speaking at our [reopening event on March 26](http://xinchejian.com/event/?regevent%5Faction=register&event%5Fid=2&name%5Fof%5Fevent=XinCheJianGrandOpening). We ran into this team founded in 2009 on Sina Weibo and are very impressed by what they are doing. We look forward to seeing their presentation.
