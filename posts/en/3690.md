Mini Workshop No. 3 will be continued by Urban Farming Team this Saturday from 1430. We will practice how to make a good cutting from existing fresh plants, so later they will form new roots and new plant. You can bring your own lovely house and garden plants otherwise, we can steal from David and Roger's ;-)
