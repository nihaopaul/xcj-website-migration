Activity fee: 200 yuan
Activity date: August 10th (Sunday) afternoon 2 o'clock
Activity location: Xinchejian
Remember that summer in middle school when you listened to the radio while doing your homework at night? When we were young, we all dreamed of DIYing a radio, but due to limitations and lack of information, many people couldn't make their dream come true.
Now the internet is very developed, but when disaster strikes, shortwave radios are still the most reliable way to receive information.
Instead of watching TV series all afternoon on the weekend, why not come to Xinchejian to learn how to DIY a radio?
No prior knowledge is required. No programming is required.
All electronic components and tools will be provided on site.
After the workshop, everyone can take a radio they made themselves back home.
Children are welcome to attend, suitable for children over 6 years old.
You can learn how to use basic DIY tools, electronic soldering techniques, and enhance your practical skills in a single afternoon. A working radio can greatly increase children's interest in technology. (It's also a great parent-child activity).
