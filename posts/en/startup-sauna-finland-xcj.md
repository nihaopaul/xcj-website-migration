Startup Sauna is a "open source" organization from Finland. They do not provide funding but coaching (different from mentoring...). The delegation (from left to right in the picture) was made up of Jevgeni Peltola (specializing in doing business in Russia), Antti Ylimultka (Startup Sauna Wingman) and Peter Vesterbacka (Rovio Mighty Eagle - they're opening an office in Shanghai). They want to create a startup hub in Helsinki by inviting selected startups internationally to come and spend 8 weeks in Finland in an intense marathon. They're looking for ideas that can work globally and good teams. Expect a warm-up event in Shanghai at the beginning of 2012.
