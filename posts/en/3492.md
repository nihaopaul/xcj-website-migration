It has been 2 weeks since oregano been transplanted into bigger pots with 4 different mediums, including soil and hydroponics which are coconut peat, perlite and vermiculite. By far, all cuttings are survived in their own home base while those in perlite are slightly shorter and smaller. Florescent lights are set up last weekend (216W in total with 4 bulbs) running 24/7, and a small fan (2.5W) is available for creating mini air circulation environment. Once timers are fixed, ideally they will be off for 6 hours every 18 hours. If you have any questions or be interested in growing your own hydroponic plants, feel free to contact David Li, Roger Mu or Jackie Hu.
