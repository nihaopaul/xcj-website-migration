Time: April 10th, 9:30 - 12:30
Instructor: Nelson Zhang studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley before dropping out to become CTO of Wearhaus, a bluetooth audio startup. He is a long-time member of Xinchejian and previously worked in hardware and software engineering roles at Leap Motion and Amazon China. As part of job he deals with all aspects of designing and manufacturing a consumer electronics product, from the drawing board to the assembly line Workshop description: In this workshop we will teach basic electronics concepts and gain experience working with the Arduino platform. Students will build a small "smart alarm" that can be easily set to alert or wake you up at different times using a remote control and automatically turn the air conditioner on or off (based on whether the room lights are on) to save power. Objectives: - Learn basic electronics concepts - Practice using various components and sensors - Learn basic C programming skills and Arduino-specific code practices - Build your own IoT device Future classes: This workshop is intended as an introduction to Arduino prototyping. The 2nd series in the electronics workshops will focus on designing printed circuit boards for projects we've built (pedometer and alarm clock), followed by a 3rd series to actually solder and fully assemble the final products. Workshop Fee: Arduino Kit with Basic Components (special discounted price) : RMB210 (Original price: 300). Workshop: RMB150 (member), RMB200 (non-member) Workshop package cost: RMB 460 (workshop with kit and 1 month XCJ membership) Please download and install Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
