Our goal is build a robot football team that can play football (soccer) in a public space. The robots can be remote controlled by children and adults, as well as play autonomously by themselves. We believe that this exhibition will draw tremendous media attention and foot traffic given the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship that will take place in June 2012. In addition, it will be the first robotic football exhibition in China where the audience can participate. Two robotic teams with seven players will play on a special football field (table size or larger). Audience members will be able to remotely control the robots. The robots can also be automatically controlled, allowing the robots to play by themselves or against human players. Each robot will be designed to wear the jersey of the color of the participating teams in the European Football Championship. We believe this exhibition will get coverage in local media, given the interest in European football, the uniqueness of the robots, and the audience participation.**Sponsorship**XinCheJian is asking for 50,000 RMB from the main sponsor of the Soccerbots Exhibition. These costs are the minimum requirements to cover the basic materials, components, tools and support costs. Due to the extreme time constraints, half of the funds (25,000 RMB) must be provided before May 18th 2012. The overall engineering cost of the Soccerbots exhibition is estimated at well over 200,000 RMB when taking into account the cost of the expert engineering team donated by Xinchejian. The exhibition will be on loan to a space designated by the sponsor for the duration of the event. Given the transportation costs, the sponsor will need to provide the field based on a design and set of specifications provided by XinCheJian. XinCheJian will provide four robotic teams of seven players, remote controllers for the audience to play, the special football field sensors, the special game ball, and recharging units for the robots. All robots, playing field, remote controls, and equipment must be returned to XinCheJian at the end of the exhibition.**Soccerbots Swarm Robotics Team**XinCheJian has assembled a team of two senior engineers, Michaelis Lutz and Edward Jiang, with over 10 years of robotics experience. Assisting them to build the robots will be more than 10 part-time engineers and designers.**Project Lead Engineers:** 
* Edward Jiang
* Edward Jiang is Vice-President of Technology at Tradesparq, the world's fastest growing trade social network. Edward is a robot enthusiast with multiple robotics projects.

**Parting words**At XinCheJian, we believe this would be a unique and attention-grabbing exhibition. This will be the first robotic football swarm game in China, which could draw interest from both traditional media and social media. Most important, we think the robots will attract lots of people who will come to watch the robots playing football! Our organization has positive visibility in the local media including magazines and TV media, many online social networks (such as Weibo) and our own blog. Our sponsor can gain positive exposure by associating itself to this ambitious and attractive project. We have a strong self-interest in seeing this project succeed and driving traffic to our sponsor to build an audience for the project and enhance our reputation as a creative and innovative space.**概念图Concept Proposals**Figure 1: Audience members watching the Soccerbots playing football.[![](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/exhibition-383x400.jpg "exhibition")](http://xinchejian.com/2012/05/15/soccerbots-robotic-football-exhibition/exhibition/)Figure 2: Proposed 3D model shell for the soccerbot robot exterior.[![](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/3d_model.jpg "3d_model")](http://xinchejian.com/2012/05/15/soccerbots-robotic-football-exhibition/3d%5Fmodel/)Figure 3: Concept of external skins for soccerbots, based on European Football teams.[![](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/external_skins1-600x372.jpg "external_skins")](http://xinchejian.com/2012/05/15/soccerbots-robotic-football-exhibition/external%5Fskins-2/)
