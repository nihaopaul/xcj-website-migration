Shanghai Jing'an Yuyuandong Road 28, No. 3 Building, 1st floor New Workshop [http://xinchejian.huodongxing.com/event/map/5244063275800] [![WeChat_1419317760](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WeChat_1419317760-290x289.jpeg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WeChat%5F1419317760.jpeg) [Register for participation](http://www.huodongxing.com/event/5261742224600 "Sign up now") Another round of benefits!  December 28th (Sunday) morning, a Jiguiyun open-source hardware gokit experience activity! Jiguiyun engineers will give on-site case lectures, and participants can also try to develop their own! Free for members! Jiguiyun, based on years of experience in smart home development, builds a smart hardware self-development platform and independently develops the Gokit smart hardware development board that connects to the cloud and WeChat to help companies wanting to produce smart homes better understand the Internet of Things. After the smart hardware device is connected to the cloud, the Jiguiyun smart hardware development platform provides free statistical analysis of smart hardware, hardware socialization, and remote firmware upgrades to developers, allowing developers to better track device usage, connect to social networks like WeChat, and remotely upgrade device firmware over the network. Developers enter the Jiguiyun backend, quickly define device functions, and the cloud automatically generates device communication protocols, virtual devices, DemoApps, and mobile SDKs.  Just simple integration can complete the development of a smart device, greatly reducing the difficulty of smart device development. GoKit incorporates common sensors, various components and expansion interfaces, and integrates with the Jiguiyun backend services to allow smart hardware developers to quickly create their own smart hardware prototypes. The components built into GoKit include: temperature and humidity sensors, infrared sensors, motors, and full-color LED lights. They can be used in combination according to the actual project requirements, or other components can be connected through expansion interfaces. Jiguiyun provides a full set of cloud platform services, adding the functions and attributes of each component as data points to the Jiguiyun backend, and generating the corresponding MCU protocol. Developers can complete the MCU development based on the protocol documents. Jiguiyun has also open-sourced 10 common smart hardware apps.
