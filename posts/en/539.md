XinCheJian was at Barcamp Shanghai! We discussed Hackerspace, Maker, Open Source Hardware, and ROBOTS!  David built a crazy robot car the night before with YM4 from Embedream, an Arduino Uno, and a HC-SR04.  The robot had independently controlled wheels, which allowed it to turn on a fixed axis. A little drawback was controlling two independent wheels while trying to go straight at 3 AM!  The robot was dedicated to a crazy Shanghai taxi driver. The session was called "THE GREEN," and making things is more fun than golf! Rick Ye talked about his open source HCR robot, which has a camera pointing upward and an automated navigation mode. It's fun to watch it walk around on its own!  Scott made a video!
