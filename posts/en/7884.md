Shuttlecock is a traditional Asian game in which players aim to keep a heavily weighted shuttlecock in the air by using their bodies, apart from the hands. To attract kidsâ€™s interest on electronics, we embed LEDs inside shuttlecock to make it blink when people kick it. It will create a much more fun and appealing experience for sports in the evening. Play it at night for even more fun! In this workshop, participants will learn - How to solder and - Build a basic circuit - Structure and mechanics of shuttlecock 

Caution: There are maybe some risks in Soldering, Parents please take care during this step.

Time: April 3rd, 17:00 - 18:00
