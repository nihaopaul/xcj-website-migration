Thanks to Miclle Zhang bringing his electronic Wave board to XinCheJian today. He hacked it out of components found on Taobao combining a Wave Board and motor from electric bike. AWESOME Hack and we had a lot of fun playing with it this afternoon. Miclle is kind enough to leave it at the space to let anyone interested to check it out.
