Personal Biography: While earning his MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business and Stanford d.school, Alec Walker collected firsthand material from influential thought leaders in entrepreneurship, innovation, and management.  He's helped organizations like Y Combinator, URS, AECOM, Wealthfront, the Institute for Human Virology, Exmedio, Starwood Hotels, and leading universities in the US and Asia.

Workshop Description: Startups in China face unique challenges lacking specific best practices.  This workshop helps entrepreneurs discover market demand and build effective teams.  
Workshop Structure:
1) Startup Team Management: Internal conflict is a major cause of startup failure.  Structured operations can boost growth by 3x. This section explores maximizing cognitive diversity, understanding different problem-solving approaches, and managing conflict effectively.  Research from Stanford, Tsinghua, and Y Combinator informs this part.
2) Demand Discovery:  Clearly defined, data-backed problems are crucial for startup success.  This section teaches methods for quickly discovering and validating real problems from users.
3) Startup Founder Dating: The workshop concludes with an open networking session where entrepreneurs pitch their ideas and find cofounders. Each pitch is limited to 3 minutes.
What to expect: Interactive sessions, team-building exercises, and lectures.  
Who should enroll: New entrepreneurs and existing startup teams seeking to improve their chances of success.
