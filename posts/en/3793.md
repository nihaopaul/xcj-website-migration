You can make your own [SwarmBot](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Moving%5Fpcb "Swarm Robots"), easily code it via Arduino GUI, do more experiments like [this one](http://groups.google.com/group/xinchejian/browse%5Fthread/thread/6f909a952409c561# "Swarm Robot multi-direction IR experiement"), take photos for [competition](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Swarm%5Frobots/AFRON%5F$10%5Fcompetition "Afron $10 robot challenge"), or help update the [installation procedure](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Swarm%5Frobots/Motor%5FPCB%5F1st%5Fbatch%5Fof%5F30 "Swarm Robot build instructions").[Swarm Robots](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Swarm%5Frobots "Xinchejian Swarm Robots") is free fun for members! Membership is only 100Y per month! We could do also lots of fun stuff for Barcamp (September 8) and Shanghai MakerFair (November 2-4)! For example "show off" behaviours like follow the leader, find the "ball", or draw pictures on floor. [More ideas](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Swarm%5Frobots "Swarm Robot ideas"). Regular Meetup Thursday night from 7pm, Other times are DIY or arrange with others :) Lots of info [here](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Swarm%5Frobots "Xinchejian Swarm information")!
