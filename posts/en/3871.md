This is a bit of a late follow up to the Barcamp Shanghai Fall 2012. Barcamp is an "unconference" where people come to share ideas, usually with a focus on technology. Over 500 people came to the event, and Xinchejian had a room to ourselves. Here are some of the things we were doing: * Xinchejian had an LED badge soldering station thanks to [Min Lin Hsieh](http://www.weibo.com/mlhsieh) * Arcade machine (Xinchejian's unofficial day care for kids) by Lionello Lunesu * Analog Line Followers and Swarm Robots by [Lutz Michaelis](https://plus.google.com/105208292068161560445) * [Social glasses](http://turing.lecolededesign.com/vgauffre/end-of-study-project-social-glasses-coming-soon/) by [Valentin Gauffre](https://plus.google.com/u/0/106283709491765333409) * [Space Gambit](http://spacegambit.org) by [Alex Cureton-Griffiths ](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101524345018253465686/) * [Lophilo](http://lophilo.com) by [Ricky Ng-Adam](https://plus.google.com/u/0/112734382006949623750) * 3D printing by Stephany Xu * Compact micro-controller board by [Sunny Jr](https://plus.google.com/101586811263929925675) * Translation Station by Victoria * Turning your stuff into a kit by [Spencer Featherstone](https://plus.google.com/106529447578779760144) * Adopt-a-Kitten by Freda * Fish poo farming by [David Li ](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101298493842506201058) * Robots Wars by [Rockets 夏青](http://www.weibo.com/夏青)Many thanks to [Paul Adams](https://plus.google.com/108684571414567306207) who was onsite all day for his help with the schedule and setup.[Read the total event recap from Techyizu](http://www.techyizu.org/recap-shanghai-barcamp-fall-2012/)Overall, it was a fun event, and we recommend finding us at the next Barcamp![![](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/xinchejian_barcamp_2012_collage_600.jpg "xinchejian_barcamp_2012_collage_600")](http://xinchejian.com/2012/09/25/barcamp-shanghai-fall-2012/xinchejian_barcamp_2012_collage_600/)
