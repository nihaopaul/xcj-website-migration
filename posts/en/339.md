Been researching wireless solutions to transmit sensor and decision data from ART in real-time, potentially enabling minimal controls (on/off/behavior) and even wireless firmware updates.

My criteria:

* Low cost (<200 RMB, ideally <100 RMB)
* Simplex or half-duplex acceptable
* Low bandwidth (>1200 bits/s)
* Low power (<100 mAh)
* Medium range (500m-1000m)
* TTL or SPI interface

Finding clear spectrum allocation information in China is difficult.  The US has a useful Frequency Allocations Chart: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_allocation>

2.4 GHz is common globally (used by Nordic nRF240L), but range is limited (50-100m).  Bluetooth and WiFi have similar range limitations and are more expensive.

Options:

* PTR8000+ [Nordic nRF905 (433/868/915MHz)]
    * <http://www.nordicsemi.com/index.cfm?obj=product&act=display&pro=83>
    * <http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=6062297954> (50 RMB!)
    * <http://www.techtoys.com.hk/RF_Modules/Nordic_905/nRF905_rev1_4.pdf>
    * Maximum range ~500m LOS
* Laipac Tech RF 900DV (900 MHz)
    * <http://www.laipac.com/easy_900dv_eng.htm>
* Laipac ASK Transmitters (315 MHz)
    * <http://www.laipac.com/easy_315a_eng.htm>
* Databridge
    * <http://www.starmanelectric.com/OrderDataBridge/tabid/71/Default.aspx>
    * <http://www.starmanelectric.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=REf/38lk/L4%3d&tabid=75&mid=456>
    * Expensive (USD 87) and possibly not locally available
* JZ871 Data RF transceiver (433 MHz or 868/915 MHz)
    * <http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/252550553/RF_data_transceiver.html>
    * <http://www.jizhuo.com/download/product_images/f/cn_f___101.pdf>
    *  If sold on Alibaba, likely suitable for China; otherwise, potentially an export-only product.

The last option appears better on paper, but the price is a concern.  I'm struggling to find it on Taobao.
