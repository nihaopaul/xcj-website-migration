A telepresence robot allows teachers or experts to remotely teach classes. It can also enable parents to remotely observe their kids performance in class. By customizing height and appearance we can make the robotic teacher more appealing to the students. Although telepresence robots already exist commercially, we believe we can make it a lot more useful on an open platform and cheaper with Shanzhai components. In addition, none of the competitors have selected this idea putting us in a category of our own while still very much focused on the educational goals of the competition. We already have propulsion and collision detection/prevention mostly worked out (through the Autonomous Robot Car project). With the iPad Shanzhai clone we have (and its integrated Wifi, video camera, host USB port, tactile screen) we have the perfect "head" of the robot. We're expecting total cost per unit to be below USD$300, allowing us to build up-to three units within the USD$900 budget. The telepresence teaching robot will make a great technological demo for our Hackerspace and get kids excited even more about robotics...
