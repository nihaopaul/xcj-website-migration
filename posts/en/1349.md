HI HACKERS! NEED A BREAK WITH YOUR ROBOT? Well, the wild bees need your skills. Become a bee hero, join the goldendusters. Goldendust is a global design project about pollination service. It aims to provide immediate efficient and desirables solutions to the phenomenon of bee extinction. Xinchejian is hosting a small scale wild bees refuge which is a flag product easy to put on your balcony or window. This way you can provide to them a safe habitat while they are pollinating flowers around. We invite everyone, hacker and non hacker to think about how we can boost man-bees interactions : being able to observe, count the bees and integrate the refuge into modern farming practices is building a strong experience and help raise awareness. You are welcome to brainstorm, online (by leaving your comments, post sketches...), at the space or by writing at infoshumus@gmail.com. We will build a bee refuge during the workshop on saturday 20th! SESSION 1 : OBSERVE We open the first session with the question : How to observe the bees? Help us to build a pictures bank that will serve local research. Help us find cheap solutions to observe the bees. Webcam, snapshot, bee robot?
