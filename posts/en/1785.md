This morning, we had two classes for the price of one: learning how to program (for non-programmers) and using the Arduino to interface with electronics. Given by Ricky and Paul with some help from Edward.

Documentation on our wiki and source on Github.

We'll be redoing the same content in different combinations of Chinese/English and experienced programmers/non-programmers.
