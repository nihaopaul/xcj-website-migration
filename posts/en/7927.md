Workshop Introduction: Processing is an open-source programming language created specifically for electronic arts and visual interaction design. Its purpose is to visually assist programming education and express digital creativity. In 2001, MIT Media Lab's Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry initiated this project. One of its fixed objectives is to be an effective tool, helping non-programmers learn programming through motivating visual feedback. The Processing language is built on the Java language, but uses simplified syntax and a graphical programming model. This workshop will focus on some very basic and important concepts in Processing. More importantly, it will guide you on how to learn it further.
