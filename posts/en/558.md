After a 3 months of experimenting in [Xindanwei](http://xindanwei.com), we have proven the potential of having a hackerspace in Shanghai but we need a bigger space. We found a new 100 square meter location in Anhua Lu and Jiangsu Lu inside a old factory. The place is definitely a ideal location for setting up a hackerspace. The new space will be ready by the end of March!

### Lovely neighborhoold

There are all kind of business around. I am sure we can use them in our making.

One big side of the room is full of window.
