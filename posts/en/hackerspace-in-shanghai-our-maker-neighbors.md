I have recently been asked quite a lot of questions about hackerspace, hacker culture and impact of hackerspace in China. This has gotten me starting to think a lot about what it means to run a hackerspace. I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood and find anything that's related to makers. The following pictures are shops with in 500 meters of our new location in Anhua Lu. It's a typical Shanghai neighborhood and quite interestingly how many maker related shops are around us.
