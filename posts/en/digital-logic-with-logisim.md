Having fun exploring [Logisim, an OpenSource digital simulation software with a tiny project](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/LED%5FMatrix%5Fdigital%5Flogic%5Fusing%5FLogisim). Perfect tool for our future [digital logic workshops ](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Digital%5FLogic)to teach basic boolean operations and logic constructs.
