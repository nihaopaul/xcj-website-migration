Time: 13:00 - 16:00, Saturday, Oct 17
Personal Biography: Hackprende is possible thanks to OMNIS, KAI Coop, and the innovation unit of the world's largest cooperative corporation, MCC. The team for this Asian adventure is led by Alesander Robleno (@AlxShow), a tech entrepreneur from Europe and former CEO of Tidelabs.  The team is completed by Oier and Walter: Oier Gonzalez (@OierGC), an enthusiastic individual inspired by leveraging and helping others utilize various technologies, consistently fostering networking and collaboration ecosystems; and Adrian Walter Stock (@Walter_Stock), experienced in implementing innovative learning methods within the Spanish educational system, with a keen interest in technology.
Project Description:  "Our world is digital; learning about technology is learning about the present and future." Hackprende Asia manifests as a workshop introducing logical programming without coding.  Participants will create their own functional video game prototypes without coding.  Following game creation, a custom controller will be built using readily available objects in the room.  Subsequently, there will be time for experimentation, including exploring new game concepts built around hacking objects to act as controllers, thereby altering their functions.
Preparations: Bring your own laptop (preferably Windows) with working USB ports and pre-installed Stencyl software (provided at the workshop).
Workshop Structure: 1. Introduction 2. Game development without coding (using Stencyl) 3. Building a custom controller (using Makey Makey) 4. Experimentation and challenge (running games/apps with the controller, hacking other objects, testing hardware, and creating additional controllers) 5. Creation sharing and conclusions.
This workshop can help you:
* Introduce you to logical programming.
* Create video games without coding.
* Prototype quickly using hardware and software integration.
* Give objects new functionalities.
* Transform the world into your invention kit.
* Develop new interaction methods (hardware and software) for your existing skills.
* Build a tangible prototype of an idea with minimal technical knowledge.
What to expect:
The workshop combines software and hardware. We'll quickly cover logical programming basics, creating a functional game prototype within an hour.  Then, we'll build a controller using various materials (e.g., LEGO, Play-Doh, paper, 3D prints). Once we have a grasp of software and object hacking, possibilities are limitless. Expect to try classic games with new control schemes, compete, and challenge yourselves.
Attendees can purchase materials used during the workshop.
Who should enroll:
This workshop is ideal for beginners and those with no coding experience.  It's suitable for anyone interested in creating products or services incorporating software and hardware integration. Experienced users will appreciate the streamlined game development approach and gain significant hardware insights due to Makey Makey's compatibility with other technologies. Makey Makey works with any application or program and is compatible with Arduino and Scratch.  Ultimately, who doesn't want to turn bananas into a piano?
Fee: RMB 200; RMB 150 for XinCheJian Members. Makey Makey: RMB 284 (additional cost for purchasing the complete Makey Makey kit after the workshop).
