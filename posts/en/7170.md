Every Sunday 10am - 12am for 10 weeks, starting from April 5th, XinCheJian will be hosting serial Arduino level 4 workshop. This is the first time ever in XinCheJian to run Level 4 Arduino workshop. As many new makers are trying to figure out their way through all possibilities with Arduino, the majority may have only attended one or two introduction sessions to Arduino and afterwards never get the chance to continue playing with all the electronic parts and start doing fun projects. Many may have put their Arduino starter kits up on the shelf to collect dust. It that's what's happening with your Arduino kits, that would be too bad and now comes your chance to pick them up again and really get to understand everything about Arduino. This serial Arduino workshop will include all parts in the starter kits. As participants finish playing with these parts, some fun projects will be introduced to the workshop. This is a workshop that will inspire you to create and make!
