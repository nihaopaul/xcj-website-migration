Making Flashy Chinese Shuttlecock (Jianzi) Shuttlecock is a traditional Asian game in which players aim to keep a heavily weighted shuttlecock in the air by using their bodies, apart from the hands. To attract kids’s interest on electronics, we embed LEDs inside shuttlecock to make it blink when people kick it. It will create a much more fun and appealing experience for sports in the evening. Play it at night for even more fun! In this workshop, participants will learn - How to solder and - Build a basic circuit - Structure and mechanics of shuttlecock 
Caution: There are maybe some risks in Soldering, relatives must pay attention in this step.
