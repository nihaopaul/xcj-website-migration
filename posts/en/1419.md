This is the result of a year's worth of work to get this thing into the air.  I've tried countless solutions and received help from many people.  Finally, it's up! Here are some pictures of the whole machine.  It's a bit ugly, but I hope you can handle it.  (Note the pictures are not included in this response). This aircraft, with the goal of achieving flight, has a minimum cost structure.  The frame was built using two yuan (US $0.30) PVC pipes and a scavenged water bottle. It's a quadcopter frame.  Two batteries, a KK flight controller, four new 1000KV motors, and four 30A ESCs were used. Here is a close-up of the control section. (Note the image is not included in this response).  Below is a video of the first flight.  (The link is not included in this response).
