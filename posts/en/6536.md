Shuttlecock is a traditional Asian game in which players aim to keep a heavily weighted shuttlecock in the air by using their bodies, apart from the hands. To attract kids’ interest in electronics, we embed LEDs inside the shuttlecock to make it blink when people kick it. This will create a much more fun and appealing experience for sports in the evening. Play it at night for even more fun! In this workshop, participants will learn:
- How to solder
- Build a basic circuit
- The structure and mechanics of a shuttlecock

**Caution:** Soldering may have some risks. Parents, please supervise children during this step.

July 26th, 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM
