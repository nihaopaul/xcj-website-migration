Today I completed the remote control car modification, which is the first step of autonomous control. This car was bought from Taobao, with a simple structure and rudimentary control. The steering is to turn the motor to the dead end, which results in very high current, and is detrimental to future fine control of autonomous movement. So I wanted to change it to servo control a long time ago. This is the whole modification process.
