Jiu Xing Market is one of the best places to go for markets for everything except electronics. The market is over 1 million square meters with over 7000 shops and stores for all sorts of building materials. Most of the shops offer customization and build-to-order services. For those who read Chinese, Baidu has a great page on it. Here is a map. Lutz and I took a quick morning walk around the area. The steel section is full of small shops, no bigger than 40 square meters, and impressive machines. Photos by David. Photos by Lutz. We should organize a tour there for the members of XinCheJian!
