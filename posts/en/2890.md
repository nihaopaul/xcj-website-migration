This will be the _last Wednesday in the old space_, given that it's a holiday we're adjusting the time to be able to bring you an explosive get-together during the day. Read on for more.  Just a quick reminder, we kindly ask that those with "stuff" in XinCheJian remove it before the 8th, and anything left behind will be considered a donation. If you'd like to help with the moving, we'll have a packing party on the 7th.  Send a message on Weibo or here if you'd like to help out. Wednesday presentations will start at 3:00pm, **not** 7pm, due to the speakers' availability and the holiday. This is a _one-time only_ adjustment; we'll return to the regular time next week. Markus Bindhammer (http://sugarshot.org/), from Germany, is an enthusiastic experimental rocketeer, amateur chemist, technician, and mathematician residing in Shanghai. Markus and his team, Selene, were a former Google Lunar X Prize competitor. Markus will be talking about "Experimental Rockets" – this will be explosive and captivating, a great way to kick off your journey to space! We've just heard that the joint space program proposal to DARPA is in negotiations for a potential contract award. Good job to everyone involved!  Upcoming events:  Arduino for Total Newbies (2012/04/14): http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=112 Mitch Altman will be teaching this workshop!  Learn Arduino programming and build your own! All in 3 hours!  (This event is filling up quickly; sign up now!) RoboRacing Competition (2012/04/22): http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=110 Are you ready? Line followers, autonomous racers, and remote specialists – take part in this year's 2nd race!

About XinCheJian XinCheJian is a community-run hackerspace in Shanghai. Without your time, workshops, donations, and memberships, we wouldn't be able to keep the space running. Please consider giving back however you can to help alleviate financial responsibilities.  We have starter memberships for 300 RMB/month, with most members opting for 500 RMB/month to support the community. Members get space access and workshop materials at cost.  We also have startup memberships for those building businesses. Volunteer Opportunities at XinCheJian: As a volunteer, you'll earn your membership and be expected to attend staff meetings at least monthly.  Apply only if you're serious.  Without our current volunteers and their shared tasks, XinCheJian wouldn't be possible! Treasurer:  Responsible for managing finances (income/outgoing spreadsheets, donation box, rent/bills, government accounting training – we'll pay for it).  Journalists:  Write at least one article per week about XinCheJian activities (project reviews, interviews).  You'll get an account, a camera, and the chance to report on exciting happenings within the space.
