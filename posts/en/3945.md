Bring out your robots! We will have an evening dedicated to Robotics talks next Wednesday evening at [XinCheJian](http://xinchejian.com/) (1035 Changle Rd, 2nd floor, Xuhui District, Shanghai, CHINA, 200031) from 19h00 to 21h00.
Talks will be between 8 and 20 minutes each. You have a robot but no presentation? Feel free to demo it before and after the talks![Prof. Dr. Rolf Pfeifer](http://ailab.ifi.uzh.ch/pfeifer/) from the [AI Lab at the University of Zurich](http://ailab.ifi.uzh.ch/) will be talking about his work in robotics (such as [Roboy](http://www.roboy.org/)) in a talk entitled “Embodied Intelligence”. Dr Pfeifer is the worldwide leader on how well designed intelligent bodies can dramatically reduce non-linear control complexity ("embodiment") and the Deputy Director of the NCCR (National Competence Center for Research in Robotics) in Switzerland. Dr Ricky Ye (叶琛) and Rockets Xia (夏青) from [DFRobot](http://www.dfrobot.com/) will bring and present a set of their commercial robots and how they’re approaching development of robots with OpenSource and OpenHardware. Spencer Featherstone and Edward Jiang (姜昊) will give an update on XinCheJian [Swarm Robots](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Xinchejian%5FShanghai%5FHackerspace%5FAFRON%5F$10%5FCompetition%5Fsubmission). Our swarm robots [placed second](http://robotics-africa.org/design%5Fchallenge.html) at the [AFRON](http://robotics-africa.org/) competition, just between Harvard and MIT! Rodolfo “Rudy” Cossovich will show off making robots with [Multiplo](http://multiplo.org/), the robot building system. Rudy has just recently successfully completed a round of fundraising on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689254125/multiplo-create-your-own-robot).
