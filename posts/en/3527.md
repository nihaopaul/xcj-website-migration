For those of you that didn't manage to make the robo race this last weekend, it began with fire, smoke and circles with Lio taking the first place, and team wall-e taking second place. Join in the next robot race in 2 months time, build, test, race! Also those that are interested in the green side of life, Roger has done a great summary of what their team has been up to http://xinchejian.com/2012/07/02/ongoing-hydroponic-projects-by-20120630/ so show up and join the team. =Wednesday Presenters= Ricky from XinCheJian will be sharing "Linux Kernel Developers gone wild!" a great talk for those looking to do their own embedded systems and the journey to /bin/sh Valentin will be talking about Minecraft, it's applications in the Hackerspace and what he wants to do in the near future! Jonas from Jonas Design will be talking about his physical designed pieces and his space, full of metal-welding-wood-shaving tools and how he comes to realize his ideas. Shen Jie will be giving a quick talk on the Light Field Cameras and showing off his Lytro, dont drop it, that brick is expensive!
