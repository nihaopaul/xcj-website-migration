The Arduino Workshop Series Physical computing are becoming popular with the wide availabilities of interesting and inexpensive sensors and actuators and the easy to use Arduino prototyping systems. Along with rapid growing of cloud based Web services, physical computing are posed to take off to become one of the key enablers for interesting new network based applications. Arduino Workshop @Xinchejian aims to promote the understanding of physical computing and provide hand on experience with Arduino platform. The workshop series consists of 27 hours in total, including 9 hours of lectures + 18 hours hands-on. Each individual workshop consists of 3 hours. Which covers: Introduction to Arduino (overview, microcontroller and electronics) – 3 hours Getting start with Arduino (IDE/Programming/Hooking up sensor) – 6 hours How to prototype with hardware – 3 hours Network communication with Arduino – 3 hours Robotics with Arduino – 6 hours Linking up with existing hardware – 6 hours The classes may be adjusted according to the groups. The cost of the courses is 2500RMB, including the Arduino starter kit (250RMB in value) and the storage box to leave your materials behind. We will also provide you two-month Xinchejian super membership (4000RMB in value) for free.
