The Arduino workshop is great for beginners looking to get started with micro-controller programming. This popular workshop at XinCheJian provides a balanced introduction, combining theory with hands-on practice.  Please don't sign up if you can't attend, as you'll be taking a spot from someone who wants to participate. This workshop will be conducted in English.  You'll need your own Arduino kit; we have kits available at XinCheJian for RMB 210.00.  Order online from DFRobot or purchase from us to support the space. Workshop Content:
* Introduction to Arduino: board, IDE
* Writing your first program
* Connecting to sensors and hardware
* Discussion and Q&A
Notes: Please bring a laptop with the Arduino environment installed.
