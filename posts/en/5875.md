We built a Pop Up Hackerspace in a container as part of the [Make+](http://makeplus.org "Make+") for accelerating Makers' project through Art. This is first to be host at the [Creative Carnival](http://www.douban.com/event/19687466/ "创想码头•魔盒嘉年华") in Shanghai. It's done and opened over the weekend! It has been a success attracting a lot of visitors interested in 3D printing, robotics and Maker Culture! People come to see projects by the local makers, take workshop on Arduino and 3D printing and having fun talking to the makers. The pop up hackerspace will start its journey around China after the [Shanghai Maker Carnival](http://shanghaimakercarnival.com "Shanghai Maker Carnival") on Oct 19-20.
