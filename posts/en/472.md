To make Arduino easier for non-programmers, I decided to start a visual programming environment similar to [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) for Arduino. 

### Similar Projects around the Web

[Modkit](http://www.modk.it/) is a similar project but at the time I wanted to start the project, it was in a closed alpha. Also, it seems that modkit is going to be proprietary and I want an open source VPL for Arduino. By the way, [Modkit CrimpCards](http://www.modk.it/crimpcards) is an awesome idea and design. 

[S4A](http://seaside.citilab.eu/scratch/arduino) (Scratch for Arduino) is another interesting project but it's for using Scratch with Arduino instead of programming for Arduino. 

[David Mellis](http://web.media.mit.edu/~mellis/) over at MIT Media Lab also has a project called "Scratch for Arduino" but no detail yet. David is also one of the creator of Arduino platform. 

### Arduino IDE and OpenBlocks

Fork [the source of Arduino IDE](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino) hosted on github to host my version [here](https://github.com/taweili/Arduino). Next stop is to find a library for the visual programming. I found a project called [OpenBlocks](http://education.mit.edu/openblocks) developed as part of the [MIT StarLogo NG](http://education.mit.edu/projects/starlogo-tng). Open Blocks is also used in Google's Android development tool [App Inventor](http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/). 

Both Arduino IDE and Open Blocks are written in Java so the integration should be smooth. Since I have done by share of Java, I decided to also use this opportunities to look into a few alternative languages running on JVM to implement this. Since I have done mostly Ruby for the past few years, [JRuby](http://jruby.org/) looks pretty good. The language I really want to use is [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) but it seems it's a bit tricky to use it embedded in a Java app. Will give both a try and see how it goes. 

# Let the hacking beging!

Hopefully, we will have a running version in the next few weeks.
