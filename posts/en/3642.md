We have been searching for Tilapia for aquaponic for a long time. Most of sellers in China we contacted won't sell us anything less then 3000 fishes. Thanks to Jia-Qi who charmed a seller on Taobao to sell us small quantity of Tilapia fingerlings. 45 of these little guys made a 72 hours journey via land and air from Guangxi to Shanghai arriving at Xinchejian at 10:30 AM. 13 didn't make it. R.I.P. The rest of them seem to be happy with the little tank we set up for them and hopefully we don't lose any more of them. They will be joining in the aquaponic project at xinchejian contributing their part to growing the veggies and in 6 to 8 months, we will also turn them into fish sticks. ;) So, when you visit xinchejian, say hello to the newest members of aquaponic project. Here are the rules of visitation: 1. Don't feed them. Roger and I will put them on scheduled diet. 2. No netting them out of water. It's bad for the fishes. 3. Do not name them. It will make it much harder to turn them into delicious fish sticks if they have names.
