This is a 2-hour workshop for beginners who want to learn how to design 3D objects from scratch using SolidWorks. No prior SolidWorks experience is needed. The workshop will be held on one of the Sundays in June, once the maximum attendee limit is reached.  You'll learn to create 3D objects in SolidWorks, starting from basic shapes and progressing to complete designs, which can be directly printed using 3D printers.
