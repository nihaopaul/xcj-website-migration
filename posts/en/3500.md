this is the 3rd week after oregano cutting been transplanted into small pots with 4 different mediums and was surprised to find out those in vermiculite/‎蛭石 grow generally better (light blue pot) than the rest; especially there are 2 out of 5 died in soil base - with 24/7 lights on, water in soil base probably be dried out faster than vermiculite, coconut peat and perlite.
