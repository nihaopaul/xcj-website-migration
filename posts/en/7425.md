Hi everyone! I'm Kevin Yu and I go to SMIC Private School in ZhangJiang. I will be interning here for the next week or so at XinCheJian. William Kim, my friend, and the other intern here at XinCheJian, introduced me to this space. I am interested in Computer Sciences and plan to study it for my undergraduate program. Currently, I am learning to code in Visual Basic and am working on a small board game application. I am also trying to start a small project here during my stay and to learn little more about Arduino using the abundance of resources here. I am looking forward to helping anyone who needs help here at XinCheJian and hope to help make the space an even better environment!
