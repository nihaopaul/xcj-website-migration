Who are you? I’m not a superhero or that guy from the big bang theory, I am however closer to a human than those would think, I am Paul Adams. What do you do? Some say I run the United states of America, but I don’t believe that, by education I’m a Graphic Designer by industry I’m a one man web development company. What inspires you? The learning process is inspirational but doing anything with stuff is just the greatest! What attracts you to the space/what do you like about the space? I like the makers, and I like making stuff, the crazy projects with the “don’t talk about it, go do it“ mentality is awesome. Plus if you’ve been around long enough you’ll start to learn things you never thought possible. An example is my first few visits to XinCheJian, I was hacking my first robot – a Hovercraft. I had no idea where to begin or what I was doing, it was He Qichen who took 10 minutes to give me the brief introduction to using a multimeter and I was setup and burning stuff quicker than you could scream ‘FIRE!” XinCheJian is a new experience, the fact you have the opportunity to do anything is mind blowing, the chance to share the chance to learn whilst being around like-minded people is phenomenal. I love the fact that the entire hackerspace community is not pretentious; true, honest people doing real things, you need to get your hands dirty, you need to build stuff. “Talkers walk but makers provoke!” (yes I should work on that one) What do you want to do/accomplish/learn/share/experience? I want to do something, accomplish many tasks, and learn as much as I can, share everything and experience both the good and bad, i have a thirst for experiencing new things, I also love the idea of being a pioneer. If there is only one thing you could share with people, what would it be? It would have to be how much I don’t know, especially some of those technical conversations that happen, I just nod my head in agreement and every now and then say “interesting, tell me more!” Tell us a secret.. One you haven't told anyone else? This last year has been fulfilling, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it, loved the bad and enjoyed the good, I wouldn’t change it. Who's your idol? Lady Ada (Limor) is my idol. Where would you rate yourself on a geeky slider? (or nerdy if you are that way) I would rate myself at 42 on the geeky slider out of 63, 2/3rd geek.
