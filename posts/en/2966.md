I was in [Shenzhen Maker Faire](http://www.shenzhenmakerfaire.com/) with Rocket and tasted the delicious sous vide eggs from [Lower East Kitchen](http://www.lowereastkitchen.com), a great new startup to bring sous vide to everyone! We have been missing the eggs since return and can't wait for the machine from Lower East Kitchen. Hackers we were, we went components shopping on Taobao to build a machine of our own. The components are fairly easy: a hot pot cooker, a PID controller and a temperature sensor. With Qichen, we built one today and cook a few eggs! They taste awesome! YUMMY!!! ;) - Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone
