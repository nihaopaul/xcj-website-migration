I was at the Shenzhen Maker Faire with Rocket and tried the delicious sous vide eggs from Lower East Kitchen, a great new startup that makes sous vide cooking accessible! We've been craving those eggs ever since we got back and can't wait for their machine. As dedicated hackers, we went component shopping on Taobao to build our own. The components are pretty straightforward: a hot pot cooker, a PID controller, and a temperature sensor. With Qichen, we built one today and cooked some eggs! They taste amazing! YUMMY!!! ;)
