Nanode is a set of improvements on the original Arduino board with an integrated Ethernet controller and a design that is easy to hand-assemble while paying attention to some details such as the placement of the board LED and reset switch. The ability to connect to the network gives us a whole new universe of possibilities for Internet-connected devices. Thanks to Ken Boak and Toby Yu for their generous donation, we'll be received five free Nanode boards to play with in the XinCheJian hackerspace. Pricing will be around 200 RMB at the moment. Below is a picture of the first two boards at XinCheJian running the default program (flashing the LED connected to pin #6). The Ethernet controller (ENC28J60) is the same we've used in the [Transfabric's interactive door project](https://github.com/xinchejian/XinCheJian-Door/blob/master/XBeeEtherShieldBridge/XBeeEtherShieldBridge.pde).
