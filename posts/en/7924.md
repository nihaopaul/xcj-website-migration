May 7 16:00 － 18:00 Workshop Fee： 350元／Xin Che Jian Members；400元／Xin Che Jian non-Members Materials Fee： 150元/person（including:50x60CM Canvas，Propylene Feedstock，Oil Paint） Workshop Description： Paul Graham said：Hacking and painting have a lot in common is that they’re both makers. Along with composers, architects, and writers, what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things. They’re not doing research per se, though if in the course of trying to make good things they discover some new technique, so much the better. They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work– that hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.
