# Wednesday Presenters

Lionello Lunesu (Lio) will be talking about Demo Scene [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene?utm%5Fsource=Xinchejian+Members&utm%5Fcampaign=92b742edea-EDM3&utm%5Fmedium=email)a computer art subculture that specializes in producing demos, which are audio-visual presentations that run in real-time on a computer. The main goal of a demo is to show off programming, artistic, and musical skills, so join him, and "just make it!"

Paul Adams will be giving us a behind the scenes tour of the Beijing design week project he's working on right now - live from Beijing, two huge visualization, interaction and responsive installations at cMoDa in Beijing about to open on Friday.
