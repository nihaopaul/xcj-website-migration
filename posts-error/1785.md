This morning, we had two classes for the price of one: learning how to program (for non-programmers) and using the Arduino to interface with electronics. Given by Ricky and Paul with some help from Edward.

Documentation on our [wiki](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Arduino) and source on [Github](https://github.com/xinchejian/XinCheJian-Workshops/tree/master/Arduino/rngadam).

We'll be redoing the same content in different combinations of Chinese/English and experienced programmers/non-programmers.
