 <!\[CDATA\[After 2 weeks of full internship at Xinchejian, I've gained valuable experiences which I couldn't have gotten at school. At school, it was more about pure academics, from Physics to Chemistry, everything was more theory-based, rather than physical. However at Xinchejian, I was lucky to play with hardware. Even though there were more cleaning than tech stuff at Xinchejian, I still loved working here. Taking computers apart, assembling them together, playing with battery pinouts... They seem too mundane to be actual tech skills,but I still learned a lot from those activities. Before I leave, I want to thank some of the people here at Xinchejian. Thanks Amanda for providing me with such an internship. Thanks Ricky for assigning tasks and motivating me to make physical stuff. Thanks Lio for teaching me technical stuff ( Ex: checking battery pinouts, php questions.. and so on. Sorry for all the disturbances I made） Thanks 老豆 for being very friendly with me and teaching me different kinds of tools and components. If I have time after stupid SATs, I would definitely visite here again. Not as a intern but as a real member :)\]\]>
