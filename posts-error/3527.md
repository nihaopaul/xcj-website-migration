 <!\[CDATA\[\[:en\]For those of you that didn't manage to make the robo race this last weekend, it began with fire, smoke and circles with Lio taking the first place, and team wall-e taking second place. Join in the next robot race in 2 months time, build, test, race! Also those that are interested in the green side of life, Roger has done a great summary of what their team has been up to http://xinchejian.com/2012/07/02/ongoing-hydroponic-projects-by-20120630/ so show up and join the team. =Wednesday Presenters= Ricky from XinCheJian will be sharing "Linux Kernel Developers gone wild!" a great talk for those looking to do their own embedded systems and the journey to /bin/sh Valentin will be talking about Minecraft, it's applications in the Hackerspace and what he wants to do in the near future! Jonas from Jonas Design will be talking about his physical designed pieces and his space, full of metal-welding-wood-shaving tools and how he comes to realize his ideas. Shen Jie will be giving a quick talk on the Light Field Cameras and showing off his Lytro, dont drop it, that brick is expensive! \[:zh\]新车间的Ricky将会做一个主题为“狂野的Linux内核研发员”的发言，这个发言将对打算做自己的嵌入系统的朋友很有帮助，也是认识Bash shell程式（ /bin/sh）的很好的过程。 Valentin将给大家讲讲风靡世界的游戏“Minecraft”，以及该游戏在创客空间的应用。他还会讲讲他将会用Minecraft要做的东西。 来自Jonas Design的Jonas将介绍他的物理设计作品以及他的工作空间——一个堆满了金属和木工工具的地方，还有他是如何实现他的灵感的。 Shen Jie也会简短的聊聊光场相机，还有炫耀一下他的Lytro相机。小心别摔了，这玩意可贵了！ \[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
