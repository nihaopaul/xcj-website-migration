 <!\[CDATA\[\[:en\]Sergey Kasich and a group of students from [Strelka](http://www.strelka.com) are planning a visit of Shanghai and its hackerspace, XinCheJian**, on December 17th from 19h00 to 21h00**. Each year Strelka brings its students to one of the metropolis of the world to do research on the theme of DiY technologies and creative communities. The students are all young (23-32 years old) active persons that have already done something in different spheres of urban culture. They are looking forward to a lecture about the space, show & tell, Q&A session and a small discussion with residents of the XinCheJian space. Members with interesting projects are invited to join in to welcome our Russian guests.**About [Strelka](http://www.strelka.com/content/vision/?lang=en)** [Strelka Website](http://www.strelka.com/?lang=en), [Strelka Flicker](http://www.flickr.com/photos/49456588@N03), [Strelka Blog](http://www.strelka.com/category%5Fen/strelka-press-2/)Strelka is an interdisciplinary institution, founded in Moscow, Russia 3 years ago.
