 <!\[CDATA\[\[gallery\] One of the big challenge of building robots is to come up with good electromechanical designs. [Google Sketchup](http://sketchup.google.com/) (now at version 8 ) is free and, as far as 3D software go, very easy-to-use with many features permitting coming up with useful plans for your next robot. Most useful for the 3D-challenged however is the [3D Warehouse](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/) with user-contributed models. You can, for example, find a model of the [Arduino Dueminalove](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=65ebac1e83702f15bf5a7d4d00dbf624&prevstart=0) and a range of sensors (such as the [Parallax Ping](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=b66a105deff26b3912d769db18b928d7&prevstart=0) or the [Sharp IR sensor](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=266adab594bd3d2bd7053d86bc3efcb6&ct=mdrm&prevstart=0)) in addition to parts such as [servomotor](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=6bab44cbd8a82b7e80c73b110d74d94f&prevstart=0) and [RC chassis](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=72d4244540e81c671d9826a79afd9186&prevstart=0). These can be directly inserted into your design by simply going to File > 3D Warehouse > Get Models. The downside is that you'll need to buy the [pricey pro version](http://sketchup.google.com/product/gsup.html) (500$USD) to get the export features - which will be handy when you when to get your mechanical parts produced. But if you're a Xinchejian member and working on a fun project, feel free to ask me to export your model to one of the [many formats available](http://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=36203). (Disclosure: I work for the company that makes Sketchup, however I don't currently have any relationship with the team.)\]\]>
