 <!\[CDATA\[\[:zh\]In addition to all usual Xinchejian goodness of sharing and helping, we are going to trial regular "Helper sessions" where:-

> 1. All questions welcome
> 2. We all share and help each other
> 3. Make & hack stuff - anything!

 .... one theme will be assistive devices as this covers a huge range of technology!

Anyone is free to suggest other themes! All languages are welcome. Proposed guidelines

> * Display "Helper sessions" welcome sign - so people know were to come (don't be shy !)
> * Setup at one table/area - with chairs and clean workspace.
> * Noisy discussions should move to another area, so main group can continue.
> * Share and document - let other people know if you had a good time, or learnt something (or not)  
>   * Ask for wiki account and how to use the wiki!
> * You need to be a member

These sessions are intended to extend the always great help available at anytime at Xinchejian :)

Aim is to fit in between formal workshop Xinchejian learning and to give some relief to Xinchejian regular members as they often spend most of their time helping others. THANKS for all the interest and support after Wednesday nights talk! When:- Trial Thursday from 7:30 starting from 11th July. If any interest we can try other times, including weekends. Where:- At [Xinchejian](http://xinchejian.com/contact-us/ "Xinchejian location")Cost:- Free, but members only ([100RMB per month, cheaper for longer periods](http://xinchejian.com/membership/ "membership")) Links - Early draft pages have been started on the wiki:- [Helper Sessions](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Helper%5FSessions "Helper Sessions - XCJ wiki") [Assistive Devices ](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Assistive%5FDevices "Assistive Devices XCJ wiki")These will be added to in coming days and weeks. Note "Helper sessions" is a draft name - fits in with Maker, hacker, and also fits in with assistive technology.
