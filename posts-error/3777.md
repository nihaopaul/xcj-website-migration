 <!\[CDATA\[\[:en\]Greetings from Berlin, Europe's nerd center these days. 10000 nerds in the old Airport Tempelhof gathering for talk, exchange of information, fun and business. Our table from [Letsmakerobots.com](http://letsmakerobots.com "Lets Make Robots") looks quite busy and we really did build some robots from scratch there. We also got some robots to show off. I brought Chopstick Junior and ALF, the analog line follower (it's selling good). Others brought a telepresence bot, 3D printer and simple fun bots. \[caption id="attachment\_3776" align="alignnone" width="300"\][![The nerd table](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_5287-300x225.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/2012/08/25/campus-party-berlin/img%5F5287/) The table looks familiar?\[/caption\]\[:zh\]\[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
