## Who are you?

My name is Lutz and I am member of Xinchejian. Now my job is robotics engineer and in my spare time i am taking photos (yeah, the Maker Portrait photos are my creation but David did the post processing). In Xinchejian I am mainly active in robotics and related workshops. I am from Germany and living 8 years in Shanghai now but if you wanna talk in Chinese to me then please be prepared that you might have to switch to English...谢谢

## Why are you member of of XinCheJian?

Well, a couple of years somebody forced me to go there...really bad things happened after the first visit. I did not only abandon my first hobby (remember...photography) but also spend less time with the great photographer Flickr group here in Shanghai. Slowly I adapted to my new life and became another person...I mutated to ... something else. Now instead of taking pictures of flowers, buildings and other stuff I am building robots, electronic things and even changed my job. I can also meet my needs to take pictures in Xinchejian since our new style is to combine those two hobbies. Now I am taking pictures of people with robots, people with lamps, with Mojito's, pretty models with 3D printed stuff on them :-) Yeah, I am happy to be member of XCJ (that's the short version) because I can meet people with the same addiction there and doing some crazy stuff together. The mix of that many cultures, languages and believes make Xinchejian to a place where you wanna be to create awesome things. Don't believe the pictures you see now, it's staged.But I can tell you, sometimes we are close to insanity...(not really, let me phrase it "There is more than meets the eye" :-)")[![IMG_1424](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1424.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG%5F1424.jpg)Photo by David (with a Canon!!!)
