 <!\[CDATA\[Hi guys! This is Yu Sun, a new intern at XinCheJian. I just finished my sophomore year studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During my study in the U.S I found that Arduino is a very powerful micro controller, with which one can make a lot of cool stuffs like remote controlled lights, and auto pet feeding machines. Thus, my goal here in XinCheJian is to hold some introductory Arduino workshops, and help people who are interested to get started on their new projects. Hope to see you in my future workshops! :D Bellow are some of the projects that I worked on in the past, a track-tracing cute little car and a basic voice controlled light:[![mmexport1436884591275](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mmexport1436884591275-169x300.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mmexport1436884591275.jpg) [![mmexport1436884546100](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mmexport1436884546100-222x300.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mmexport1436884546100.jpg) \]\]>
