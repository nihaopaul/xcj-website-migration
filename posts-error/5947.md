The Pop Up Hackerspace in the container made it to XuJiaHui this week in front of the [Grand Gateway Mall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand%5FGateway%5FShanghai). This is one of the busiest intersection in Shanghai. Jointly with [Make+](http://makeplus.org) and [Shanghai Maker Carnival](http://shanghaimakercarnival.com/sh-en/index.aspx), there will be workshops, presentations and robot races on Sep 28th!
