 <!\[CDATA\[To get ready for the Robot Contest event on 1/16, I order the RMB 58 RC cars from Taobao. This RC car is good size and properly built. Originally, I wanted to go with the route of replacing the control board with Arduino and drive everything there.![IMG_0193.JPG](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0193.jpg "IMG_0193.JPG")As I was trying to hook up the motor to Arduino, I realized that there wasn't any [H Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-bridge) and it was way too cold to go out and get it. Hmm... I figure there must be some H Bridge on the control board I just rip out of the car.![IMG_0216.jpg](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0216.jpg "IMG_0216.jpg")As I located the two H bridge on the board, I notice the RX-2 chip. Out of curiosity, I decide to google for this chip. To a pleasant surprise, I found [RX-2/TX-2 Datasheet in Chinese](http://xinchejian.com/?attachment%5Fid=345) and [guide](http://xinchejian.com/?attachment%5Fid=347) for exactly the board in the car and remote.![IMG_0215.jpg](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0215.jpg "IMG_0215.jpg") ![untitled.jpg](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/untitled.jpg "untitled.jpg")Decide to replace RX-2 in the car with Arduino so the H-Bridge on board can be reused and the RF for the remote can still work. Still trying to figure out what I am going to do with those remote control signal. A few facts about RX-2/TX-2 chip I found is that the RC frequency can be adjusted by different resistance from 100K to 500K Ohm between OSCI/OSCO pins.![untitled.jpg](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/untitled1.jpg "untitled.jpg")\]\]>
