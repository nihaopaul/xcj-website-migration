 <!\[CDATA\[\[:zh\]这个周三晚上新车间和[iTalk沙龙](http://www.italksalon.com)很荣幸的可以邀请到前富士康总裁程天纵先生来分享他对创客运动，中国创新的看法。

## 有关程天纵先生

程老今年61岁，92到97年在北京任惠普总裁 ，97年到2007年任德州仪器亚洲区总裁，2007年到2012年任富士康集团副总裁。在过去的一年中，研究了全球创客发展生态，而由于其之前几十年一直是大公司的职业经理人身份，所以他对创客发展的观点更偏向于从战略和使命层面来看。这对于目前的国内创客发展情况来看，更值得去从价值观上进行学习。

## 时间和地点

考虑到这次对这个演讲的热烈兴趣，这个开放夜将在新车间附近的湖南社区文化中心的5楼多功能会议室举行**日期:12/11号周三** **时间:晚上7点** **地点: 乌鲁木齐中路164号，近安福路，5楼会议室, 湖南街道文化中心** ![NewImage](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/NewImage.png "NewImage.png") [![Untitled](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/untitled.jpg "untitled.jpg")](http://share.csdn.net/slides/1140)
