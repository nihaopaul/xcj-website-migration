There were some minor hiccups with part changes and delivery, but the batteries and chargers have now arrived. Workshop attendees can be collect these at the Wednesday Open night and presentation night or at Thursday nights SwarmRobot makers night, or by arrangement. The SwarmRobots have also been entered into a worldwide educational competition, see our entry [here](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Xinchejian%5FShanghai%5FHackerspace%5FAFRON%5F$10%5FCompetition%5Fsubmission "AFRON Competition submission").[![SwarmRobot](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SwarmRobot-300x225.jpg "SwarmRobot")](http://xinchejian.com/2012/09/17/swarm-robots-workshop-and-competition-entry/swarmrobot/)\[:zh\][![SwarmRobot workshop](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SwarmRobot_workshop-300x225.jpg "SwarmRobot workshop")](http://xinchejian.com/2012/09/17/swarm-robots-workshop-and-competition-entry/swarmrobot%5Fworkshop/)上周六，我们成功地举办了第一场群体智能机器人工坊，有10位成员参与其中：3位10岁左右的小创客，4位美女和3位帅哥。虽然过程中有些小插曲（元件替换和未收到电池），但现在电池和充电器都已经就位了。工坊成员可以在本周三晚上的开放活动，或是周四晚上的群体智能机器人小组聚会，过来领取电池和充电器，也可以发邮件到：staff@xinchejian.com 另约时间。 另外，新车间的群体智能机器人也已经参与到了世界范围内的教育比赛中，详情可点击[这里](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Xinchejian%5FShanghai%5FHackerspace%5FAFRON%5F$10%5FCompetition%5Fsubmission) [![SwarmRobot](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SwarmRobot-300x225.jpg "SwarmRobot")](http://xinchejian.com/2012/09/17/swarm-robots-workshop-and-competition-entry/swarmrobot/)\[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
