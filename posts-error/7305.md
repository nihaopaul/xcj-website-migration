Workshops are run on a wide range of topics and when there are enough requests, this also includes an introduction the to Machine Room and also how to use the CNC and laser cutter. To help members begin to learn how to CNC, a draft guide has been started [here](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/XinFab%5FCNC%5Fusage%5Fand%5Foverview%5Fguide). You can practice at home! This guide also gives good skills for learning how to laser cut and some for 3D printing. Members are also encouraged to help add more [guides and improve the existing ones](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Category:Guide).\]\]>
