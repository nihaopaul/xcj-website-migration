 <!\[CDATA\[\[:en\] XinCheJian's second Makers' Hour was held on July 29th, during an open night event. Many makers gathered around a table to discuss about their individual projects and insights. Here are some of the makers involved in the discussion:[![1102926626](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1102926626-e1438241807697-224x300.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1102926626-e1438241807697.jpg)Mr. Wu, who also attended Makers' Hour the week before, is working on a wireless camera. He wishes to integrate technologies such as Raspberry Pi to create a wireless and wearable camera.[![1129904720](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1129904720-e1438241957907-224x300.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1129904720-e1438241957907.jpg)These three young men made their own motorcycle and are ready to manufacture and sell within this year. They wish to bring in technologies such as Bluetooth headset helmets and mobile device applications to accompany their product.[![860826492](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/860826492-e1438241789975-224x300.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/860826492-e1438241789975.jpg)Jerry is able to control his wireless LED panel through a mobile application. His application can not only change the brightness but also the color temperature of the light source. He believes color temperature has an effect on the productivity and emotions of a person. XinCheJian strongly encourages makers to come by on Wednesday nights to present their creations. By having makers communicate with one another, makers can gain insight and opportunities they would not have had working alone. Through making connections with each other, makers may overcome problems they have with the project, find partners to collaborate with, and sharing experience about commercializing products. Makers' Hour is for makers who have physical projects to show. This means projects such as: embedded devices, robots, internet of things, and other practical devices. We will be strict about not having people without physical projects. \[:\] \[:zh\] 新车间第二次的“创客一小时”已经在7/29的开放夜之后举办了，许多很有想法及进行项目中的创客们聚集在一起共同集思，讨论。以下是其中三位创客的研究成果：[![1102926626](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1102926626-e1438241807697-224x300.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1102926626-e1438241807697.jpg)上周第一次莅临的吴先生希望把Raspberry Pi 带入他正在做的无线穿戴式相机中。[![1129904720](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1129904720-e1438241957907-224x300.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1129904720-e1438241957907.jpg)这三位年轻人研发的的摩托车即将上市。他们希望在配件的安全帽上可以有蓝牙耳机功能。[![860826492](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/860826492-e1438241789975-224x300.jpg)](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/860826492-e1438241789975.jpg)这位先生制作的LED平板灯可以通过手机软件无线控制其亮度及色温。他认为灯的色温可以影响一个人的情绪以及工作效率。 新车间鼓励创客们在周三开放夜来展示自己的创作。分享者可以通过与小伙伴们探讨，互相学习，并获得更多的想法与支持和解决问题的方法。也希望通过互相学习了解，真正在创作的创客们能够在新车间找到志同道合的伙伴，共同完成创作项目。’创客一小时’仅限有实际项目的小伙伴们参加，项目范围需与智能硬件物联网等相关。欢迎小伙伴们携带自己的项目参与！ \[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
