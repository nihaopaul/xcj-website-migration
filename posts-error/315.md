CPLD seems particularly well-suited, and although my initial applications will be simple, I anticipate many real-time robotics tasks (sensor processing, PWM control) would benefit from CPLD hardware designs.  I'm considering purchasing these items: Xilinx Platform Cable USB (programs Xilinx CPLD/FPGA) - $228.00  Expensive but usable for many Xilinx XC9572XL CPLDs in a DIP40 package - $42.00.  Convenient for breadboard use, and has 1,600 usable gates (much more than currently needed for the ultrasonic sensor selector). Here are some relevant CPLD links:  CPLDs offer several advantages: small CPLDs can replace several standard logic ICs (74xxx, etc.), large CPLDs can replace hundreds. This reduces circuit board space and power consumption. CPLD logic functions are user-programmable and typically erasable and reprogrammable, allowing on-the-fly changes.  Hardware connections become software (hardware description language).  Input/output pin assignments are user-configurable, simplifying circuit board layout. Many CPLDs are in-system programmable, enabling circuit function changes after construction without re-wiring. CPLD prices have decreased, making them more viable.  However, complexity increases.  While connecting a few logic gates with 74xxx ICs is simple, significant software, hardware, and knowledge barriers exist with CPLDs.  Once overcome, design modification and more complex implementations (unfeasible with standard logic) become easier. My recent H-bridge controller, implemented on a PIC microcontroller, worked adequately, but performance was suboptimal due to limitations in I/O lines. A CPLD allows dedicated hardware for components like PWM control, H-bridge logic, and I2C interfaces, operating at hundreds of MHz rather than kHz. Hobbyist CPLD/FPGA use was hindered by issues that have now been largely resolved. CPLDs and microcontrollers complement each other: CPLDs are ideal for high-speed, limited-complexity tasks. Microcontrollers excel at complex operations, albeit at lower speeds. CPLDs are a step towards full custom designs, with silicon manufacturers offering affordable, powerful devices in low quantities.  Entry-level software tools have also become significantly more accessible.  Behavioral descriptions define system functionality (behavior) without detailing component connections.  This can use Boolean expressions or more abstract models (e.g., Register Transfer or Algorithmic levels).

Structural descriptions detail system components and interconnections, similar to a schematic."},"zh": "正如我在之前的博文中提到的，为了增加更多连接到 Arduino 的超声波传感器，我正在考虑将一些逻辑实现到 Arduino 外部的数字逻辑门中。研究了一段时间后，我偶然想起大学时学过的 FPGA 和 CPLD。CPLD 似乎特别适合，尽管我的初始应用很简单，但我预计许多机器人实时任务（传感器处理、PWM 控制）将受益于 CPLD 硬件设计。我正在考虑购买这些物品：Xilinx 平台电缆 USB（用于编程 Xilinx CPLD/FPGA）—— 228.00 美元。价格昂贵，但可用作许多 Xilinx XC9572XL CPLD（DIP40 封装）的编程工具——42.00 美元。这种封装便于面包板使用，而且有 1600 个可用门（远比当前超声波传感器选择器需要的更多）。以下是一些相关的 CPLD 链接：CPLD 提供多种优势：小型 CPLD 可以取代多个标准逻辑 IC（例如 74xxx 等），大型 CPLD 可以取代数百个。这减少了电路板空间和功耗。CPLD 逻辑功能是用户可编程的，通常可以擦除和重新编程，允许即时更改。硬件连接变成了软件（硬件描述语言）。输入/输出引脚分配是用户可配置的，简化了电路板布局。许多 CPLD 具有系统可编程功能，可以在构建后更改电路功能而无需重新布线。CPLD 价格已下降，使其更具可行性。然而，复杂性也随之增加。虽然使用 74xxx IC 连接几个逻辑门很简单，但使用 CPLD 存在显著的软件、硬件和知识障碍。一旦克服，设计修改和更复杂的实现（使用标准逻辑无法实现）将变得更容易。我最近实现的 H 桥控制器使用 PIC 微控制器，虽然工作正常，但性能欠佳，因为 I/O 线存在限制。CPLD 允许为 PWM 控制、H 桥逻辑和 I2C 接口等组件分配专用硬件，工作频率达到数百兆赫兹，而不是千赫兹。业余爱好者使用 CPLD/FPGA 曾受困于一些问题，但现在这些问题已得到很大程度的解决。CPLD 和微控制器互为补充：CPLD 非常适合高速、低复杂性任务。微控制器擅长复杂操作，但速度较慢。CPLD 是朝完全自定义设计的步骤，硅厂商以低价提供功能强大的设备（小批量）。入门级软件工具也变得更加易于获得。行为描述定义了系统功能（行为），无需详细说明组件连接。这可以使用布尔表达式或更抽象的模型（例如，寄存器传输或算法级别）。例如，汽车警告系统可以具有以下行为描述：Warning = Ignition_on AND (Door_open OR Seatbelt_off)。结构描述详细说明了系统组件和互连，类似于原理图。"

 <!\[CDATA\[As I've mentioned in the previous blog post talking [about adding more ultrasonic sensors connected to the Arduino](http://xinchejian.com/?p=305) , I'm looking at implementing some of the logic in digital logic gates external to the Arduino... After researching this for a while, I've stumbled on something half-remembered from university: FPGA and CPLD. CPLD seems particularly well suited and although my first few applications would be very simple, I'm thinking many of the real-time stuff needed by robotics (sensor processing, PWM control) would be well served by CPLD hardware designs. So I'm thinking about buying these two things:[Xilinx Platform Cable USB (programs Xilinx CPLD/FPGA) 228.00元](http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=7632619729&ali%5Frefid=a3%5F420434%5F1006:1102526646:6:xilinx:216dcf9ee9bbd093f948aeb818bba62c&ali%5Ftrackid=1%5F216dcf9ee9bbd093f948aeb818bba62c)Expensive but can be used to program very many CPLD[XILINX XC9572XL in a DIP40 package: 42.00元](http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=5859127056)Very convenient packaging that will work with the breadboard in addition to having, from the datasheet, "1,600 usable gate" (about 100 times what I need right now for the ultrasonic sensor selector....) These are some useful links about CPLD:<http://bitcycle.org/electronics/1st%5FCPLD%5Fproject/> _CPLD's have a number of useful properties:_ _A small CPLD can replace the function of a handful standard logic IC's (74xxx etc), a large CPLD can replace the function of hundreds of these. The result is a drastic reduction in circuit board space, and power consumption. The logic function performed by a CPLD is user-programmable. Normally it can be erased, and re-programmed many times. That is: can be changed on-the-fly. What used to be hardware (wires / connections), becomes software (hardware description language). Which input or output pin is used for what signal, can be chosen by the user. This helps to simplify circuit board layout. Many CPLD's (not all) are in-system programmable. That is: the function of a circuit can be changed after it has been built, without re-wiring or replacing components. The price of CPLD's (and other programmable logic devices) has come down enough to make their use feasible in many designs. These advantages come at a cost: complexity. While it is simple to connect a few logic gates using 74xxx IC's, a significant barrier has to be overcome to do the same with a CPLD. This barrier consists of required hardware, software & knowledge. However: once this barrier has been overcome, it becomes easier to modify a design. Also one can tackle more complex designs, that would be (near) impossible using standard logic._ <http://www.mouldy.org/using-cplds-and-fpgas-in-hobby-electronics> _As an example, my recent H-bridge controller was implemented on a PIC microcontroller. This worked well enough, but performance was suboptimal, and some nasty hacks were required because the I/O lines couldn't do exactly what I wanted. With a CPLD, I have dedicated hardware to implement things like the PWM controller, H-bridge logic and I2C interface; these subsystems would have operating frequencies in the hundreds of megahertz, instead of kilohertz._ _A few years back, there were crippling problems that prevented hobbyists from making use of CPLDs and FPGAs. Just about all of these have been remedied._ <http://www.triplespark.net/elec/pdev/cpld/> _CPLDs don't replace microcontrollers and vice versa; in fact, they complement one another very well: CPLDs are good if you need speed as long as the complexity of the task is limited. In contrast, microcontrollers can do lots of fancy things but at slower speed._ <http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/200006/cpld.htm> _PLDs or Complex Programmable Logic Devices are the next extension to the PLD market. They are today's technological stepping stone between a handful of discrete gates and a full custom design. What's more, the silicon manufacturers are so interested in beginning engineers down the path of brand loyalty, that one & two quantity pricing is around five dollars for surprisingly powerful devices. At the same time, entry level software development tools have evolved from multi-thousand dollar price tags to free (Public Domain) Inter Net downloads while at the same time, continuing to gain in power._ <https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese201/vhdl/vhdl%5Fprimer.html> _The highest level of abstraction is the behavioral level that describes a system in terms of what it does (or how it behaves) rather than in terms of its components and interconnection between them. A behavioral description specifies the relationship between the input and output signals. This could be a Boolean expression or a more abstract description such as the Register Transfer or Algorithmic level. As an example, let us consider a simple circuit that warns car passengers when the door is open or the seatbelt is not used whenever the car key is inserted in the ignition lock At the behavioral level this could be expressed as,_   _Warning = Ignition\_on AND ( Door\_open OR Seatbelt\_off)_ _The structural level, on the other hand, describes a system as a collection of gates and components that are interconnected to perform a desired function. A structural description could be compared to a schematic of interconnected logic gates. It is a representation that is usually closer to the physical realization of a system._ \]\]>
