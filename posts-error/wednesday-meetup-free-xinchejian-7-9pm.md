{"en": "Makers and Breakers, hello again from XinCheJian. It's Wednesday already; we're at it again! It's time to get off the couch or out of the rain and come hang out with us at XinCheJian and make stuff.\n\nTonight's Topics:\n\nWe should have three interesting topics tonight: Farming in an Urban Window, presented by Jeff; followed by the 8x8x8 cube you might have seen on the mailing list.  If anyone knows, the 8x8x8 cube takes some serious multiplexing—find out how many pins this guy uses! Also, Raven will kick off the show with his awesome Processing introduction for those interested in signing up for the Processing workshop.\n\nNotice:\n\nXinCheJian is run by volunteers. By donating time, toys, or money, we can keep the space thriving. If you're interested in joining our team, we have volunteer and community-driven internship positions available (details in this newsletter). If you can't help out by becoming a member, consider buying a drink from the fridge or some kits; every little bit helps.\n\nWhat Else is Happening This Week at XinCheJian:\n\n* Thursday, 7 PM: Embedded engineers event (in Chinese) by Shen Jie, with pizza!\n* Friday, 7 PM: Habib from MakeSense Social Enterprises & Companies meetup\n* Saturday, 3 PM: Shyul Lee giving an introduction to FPGA and ARM (http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=82)\n* Sunday, 2:30 PM: InsectBot workshop by David and Lutz. This is a great workshop for getting started with Arduino and experiencing the hackerspace. Highly entertaining, safe for kids and adults.  \"The Insect bot workshop got me started at XinCheJian back in May. Confused and disoriented about a hackerspace? This put me on the right path to making great things!\" – Paul. Sign up here: (http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=75)\n\nMemberships:\n\nBecoming a XinCheJian member supports our community and gives back. Choose your membership level: 300 RMB or 500 RMB per month, which helps keep the space alive and replace consumables.\n\nOpen Volunteer Positions at XinCheJian:\n\nAs a volunteer, you'll earn your membership and be expected to attend Tuesday staff meetings (7-9 PM). Apply only if you're serious about volunteering!  Without the generosity of our volunteers, it would be nearly impossible to keep XinCheJian alive.\n\n* Treasurer: Responsible for managing finances (income/outgoing spreadsheets, donation box, rent/bills, contacting founders for additional funding, reminding members to pay membership dues).  You'll need a calculator and experience with record-keeping.\n* Event Manager: Plays a key role in keeping the space running smoothly and providing clear information.  This is a dedicated position requiring several hours per week online.  This person needs to be compassionate but firm, well-organized, able to follow up, and personable, making it easy for people to run workshops.  Responsibilities include scheduling events, confirming events with participants, encouraging content creation for promotion, handling external media, and posting events on the XinCheJian site.\n* Journalist: Write at least one article per week on happenings at XinCheJian.  Choose a project, review it, interview people, and write.  This involves writing a few hours a night and a few hours a day interviewing.  You'll receive an account on xinchejian.com.
