First was how do these things work! Not exactly rocket science, but they do mean looking up the datasheets to get the schematics and a little trial and error. Then it was deciding what form it should take; perhaps a representation of a tree would be ideal! So with 3D printed parts, the tree was assembled with rubber bands. Unfortunately, both the bands and 3D printed parts weren't working very well.[![IMG_20130526_180103](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_20130526_180103-300x225.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG%5F20130526%5F180103.jpg)The 3D printed parts were scrapped in favor of Ping Pong balls (we had hundreds leftover from a prank on Lucio's locker) and string.[![IMG_20130526_235609](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_20130526_235609-225x300.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG%5F20130526%5F235609.jpg)Finally, the little thing was built, hooked into Pachube/Cosm/Xively (or whatever you want to call it today), and data is starting to flow. We also built a second one to contrast the information and see which one is more accurate; the readings from the one located 800m from the US embassy in Shanghai. So, without further ado, meet the tree! It's version 1, sitting atop Burty, so we can understand its readings before making a permanent one with the chosen sensor. If you're looking for the data, it's here. Please remember we're not stating facts and aren't guaranteeing the data's accuracy as we have nothing to calibrate against: <https://xively.com/feeds/135383882> The code can be found at <https://github.com/xinchejian/pm2.5-arduino>. The pm25-tree data comes from the tree using a SeeedStudio dust sensor, which doesn't seem entirely accurate. In contrast, the pm25 data is from a Sharp sensor, which so far seems accurate. However, smoke tests haven't affected the Sharp sensor readings, unlike the SeeedStudio sensor. Time will tell. Stay tuned for more from Valentin.", "zh": null}
