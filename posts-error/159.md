Today, Seeed Studio employs over 30 engineers and support staff with over USD$1 million in annual revenue mainly from US, Europe, and Japanese customers, which account for 98% of its business. Seeed does not yet focus on the Chinese market as Eric points out that the tinkers/makers community in China has not yet matured enough for Seeed and there is not enough community. Seeed Studio has so far relied on word-of-mouth within the open hardware community for its marketing and will launch its first marketing campaign in 2011.

The WISH platform allows designers and users to propose requests and new designs, and through community voting and pre-ordering processes, helps bring products to market. The process is best illustrated by this slide from the speech. Seeed also works with partner sites such as [Dangerous Prototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/) to promote the platform.![untitled.jpg](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/untitled2.jpg \"untitled.jpg\")Eric's 30-minute talk was followed by over 2 hours of heated discussion on the topics of open source hardware, innovation, and manufacturing. The talk and discussions were livecast on Sina Weibo by [Steven Cheng](http://t.sina.com.cn/iamstevencheng) under [#新山寨#](http://t.sina.com.cn/k/%25E6%2596%25B0%25E5%25B1%25B1%25E5%25AF%25A8&rd=MjAzM&page=1).", "zh": "今天，我们在[新制造](http://xinchejian.com/)启动了“新山寨”系列讨论会的第一场，探讨了“山寨”微型制造效率如何结合开放式创新流程和开源硬件来改变中国创新方式。我们荣幸地邀请到[Seeed Studio](http://seeedstudio.com)的首席执行官兼创始人潘巍先生做主题演讲[“促进开放式创新——Seeed Studio 的方法”\[演讲幻灯片\]](http://www.slideshare.net/seeedstudio/facilitate-open-innovation-the-seeed-studio-approach)。![IMG_0138.JPG](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_0138.jpg \"IMG_0138.JPG\")Seeed Studio 三年前在深圳成立，旨在探索将开源硬件与深圳的电子供应链相结合。如今，Seeed Studio 拥有 30 多名工程师和支持人员，年营收超过 100 万美元，主要来自美国、欧洲和日本客户，占其业务的 98%。正如潘巍先生指出的那样，Seeed 目前并不专注于中国市场，因为中国爱好者/创客社区尚未成熟，社区规模不足。Seeed Studio 目前主要依靠开源硬件社区的口碑进行营销，并将于 2011 年启动其首个营销活动。以下是将在[Make Magazine](http://makezine.com/)刊登的广告之一。![untitled.jpg](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/untitled1.jpg \"untitled.jpg\")Seeed 目前重点是发展其[WISH 平台](http://wish.seeedstudio.com/)，正如潘巍先生所描述的那样，该平台是一个生态系统，旨在帮助开源硬件设计师更好地管理产品生命周期。WISH 平台允许设计师和用户提出需求和新设计，并通过社区投票和预订流程帮助产品进入市场。该流程通过演讲中的幻灯片最好地说明。Seeed 还与合作伙伴网站如[Dangerous Prototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/)合作推广该平台。![untitled.jpg](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/untitled2.jpg \"untitled.jpg\")潘巍先生的 30 分钟演讲后，紧跟着是超过 2 个小时关于开源硬件、创新和制造的热烈讨论。演讲和讨论通过[Steven Cheng](http://t.sina.com.cn/iamstevencheng)在新浪微博上进行直播，话题标签为[#新山寨#](http://t.sina.com.cn/k/%25E6%2596%25B0%25E5%25B1%25B1%25E5%25AF%25A8&rd=MjAzM&page=1)。"}
