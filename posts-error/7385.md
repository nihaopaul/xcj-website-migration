 <!\[CDATA\[To provide a better service for makers, we have had storage boxes so that makers don't have to carry their heavy, precious projects home and take the projects back to Xinchejian. However, the problem with the storage boxes was that the labels on the boxes did not tell a complete information about the maker. It only contained the names ( sometimes they don't even have names) . No contact info, expiry date and so on. To solve the issues, I have created new labels for makers to fill out.[![851426127](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/851426127-300x225.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/851426127.jpg)[![1539776165](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1539776165-300x225.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1539776165.jpg)The new label includes, name, email, phone, today's date and expiry date. With these information, it is now easier to identify the information about the user. The new label is attached to each boxes, so **if you own a storage box , please go fill in the labels up ASAP.** If you want more label papers, they are available on the top of the fridge. \]\]>
