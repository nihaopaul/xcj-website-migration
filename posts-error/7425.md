 <!\[CDATA\[\[:en\]Hi everyone! I'm Kevin Yu and I go to SMIC Private School in ZhangJiang. I will be interning here for the next week or so at XinCheJian. William Kim, my friend, and the other intern here at XinCheJian, introduced me to this space. I am interested in Computer Sciences and plan to study it for my undergraduate program. Currently, I am learning to code in Visual Basic and am working on a small board game application. I am also trying to start a small project here during my stay and to learn little more about Arduino using the abundance of resources here. I am looking forward to helping anyone who needs help here at XinCheJian and hope to help make the space an even better environment! \[:\] \[:zh\]大家好！我的名字叫Kevin，我是中芯民办学校的高中生。在这几个礼拜内，我会在新车间实习。是William，我的朋友（也是这边的实习生）介绍给我来新车间的。我对计算机科学感兴趣所以准备在大学主修这门科。现在我在学VB编程语言来做一个棋类游戏的软件。我想要在新车间做出我自己的项目并学会用Arduino。我很期待去帮助这边的会员，也希望能更好的改进这个地方。谢谢大家！ \[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
