 <!\[CDATA\[\[:en\]My outdoor aquaponic farm survived well through the typhoon Haikui hitting Shanghai. The few plants in the grow bed did well and starting to show amazing growth. The basil at the middle are growing beautifully. Basil are not used much in the home cooking. Anyone who like to taste some aquaponic basil, let me know. I will bring some to the space.![Image](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/image.jpg "image.jpg")The system is still showing some sign of the young aquaponic system, a bit iron deficiency. Chelated iron has been added to improve that as well as a bag of coral skeleton is added as PH buffer.![Image](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/image2.jpg "image.jpg")\[:zh\]在海葵来的时候还非常的担心户外的鱼菜共生系统会有很大的影响，幸好没有出什么问题，这几天成长开始快了。在照片中间的罗勒长的很漂亮。我会带一些到新车间，有兴趣品尝的朋友可以过来。![Image](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/image.jpg "image.jpg")在系统里面加入了珊瑚做为PH的调节，也加入了铁肥，补充这样还在初期的鱼菜共生系统这个方面的不足。![Image](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/image2.jpg "image.jpg")\[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
