 <!\[CDATA\[[Jiu Xing Market](http://www.jiuxing.com.cn/) is one of the best place to go for markets for everything except electronics. The market is over 1 million square meter with over 7000 shops and stores for all sort of building materials. Most of the shops offer customization and build to order services. For this who reads Chinese, Baidu has [a great page on it](%5Fblank). Here is a map.![NewImage](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/NewImage.png "NewImage.png")Lutz and I took a quick morning walks around the area. The steel section are full of small shops no bigger then 40 sqm and impressive machines.
