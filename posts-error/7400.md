# Smart Pet Collar Project Startup

![王可可带上iwatch](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/王可可-iwatch-300x182.png)\[:en\] Have you shown photos of your cute pets on Instagram, with proud and excitement? When your good boy looks pale, have you worried about its health, but feel helpless in caring for it? Even, when thinking of dognap news reported on TV, have you woke up suddenly in a fear, feeling afraid of the terrible result if being careless? You should have been enjoying assured simple fun with pets, yet it’s always so hard to be assured in reality. But now, it’s time to let my efforts ease your trouble! With the rapid development of wearable products, glasses, bands, or even shoes have been made ‘smart’ by geeks. A billionaire even put the smartwatch on his puppy’s paw, however, it made a stupid error that only one third of the dog’s pulse was detected. No doubt that pets need something especially for them! In the remaining summer vacation, I’ll make a prototype of the smart collar. I’ll try to acquire Lua and Android programming next week. Simple communication and using accelerometer are the short term goals as well. Any tutoring, directing or advices will be appreciated, and much thanks to you here in advance. I’m going to take part in the Xinchejian Hackathon in early August, and complete the prototype later that month. It will achieve some preliminary functions including data gathering, Wi-Fi communicating and mobile app connecting. At the same time, it can play a role as developing platform for future products as well. Furthermore, an improved product with track and trace, health detection, entertainment and other surprising features will be shown at the end of this year, starting the experimental manufacturing then as well. To achieve the commercial value of the technology will be my goal right in 2016\. Besides, as a caring young man, I really hope to take more social responsibilities by innovation. After sales, I plan to provide the products for all the 27 guide dogs (1 missed 3 days ago) for free. The useful functions can greatly improve the safety for the blind and their dogs, protecting the precious resource of guide dogs and helping the disabled. \[:\] \[:zh\] 宠物智能可穿戴设备项目启动介绍 你有骄傲地秀过你家萌宠的照片吗？小东西面色不好，你也担心过它是否生病，却手足无措，心如刀割么？甚至想起别家小狗被拐卖的新闻时，害怕自己疏忽而从冷汗中惊醒吗？你本该与它时刻尽享轻松乐趣，现实中你却总难放下心来…… 但现在，是时候让我的努力，解决你的困扰啦！ 可穿戴式设备发展至今，我们已经在眼镜、手环、甚至鞋子上无所不用其极。某位土豪将智能手表戴上了汪星人的爪子，但测出的心率却低于普通狗的3倍！的确，可爱的宠物们需要专为它们定制的智能产品。 剩下的七月和八月里，我计划打造一款具有初步功能的智能项圈样机。下周，我将尝试熟悉Lua与安卓的编程、简单通信，以及通过Arduino了解加速度传感器的使用。届时将欢迎各路大神的指点，也在这里提前感谢你们。 暑假里，我将参加八月初的“黑科松”，在八月中下旬完成样机的制作，并进行项目的成果展示。样机将能够实现传感器数据采集、在wifi条件下的数据传输、以及与手机App的联通。这款样机也将成为宠物智能可穿戴设备的开发平台，为未来功能更完善的产品奠定基础。 同时，在今年年末的时候，一款具备追踪定位、健康监测、游戏娱乐、以及更多意想不到功能的成熟产品将依据规划进入试产，并在2016年实现技术的商业价值。 此外，作为一名有爱心的年轻人，我也非常希望在创造科技的同时，履行更多的社会责任。在产品发售后，我将把产品免费提供给上海正在使用的27条导盲犬（1条在三天前走失），本装置将极大地提升人与犬的安全性，保护珍贵的导盲犬资源，更让残疾人和他们的家庭更放心。 \[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
