Small aquaponic indoor is fun and building big one outdoor is even better. These system is of two 500L fish tanks at the bottom and two 300L growing bed on top giving about 2 square meters growing space and capacity for about 50+ fishes. I am still trying to figure out how to get Tilapia in Shanghai but for now, carps will do. ;)
