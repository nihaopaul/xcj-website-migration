 <!\[CDATA\[\[:en\][![P1000580](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000580_thumb.jpg "P1000580")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000580.jpg) [Makercarnival](http://makercarnival.com/) is the first of its kind in Beijing, at the Contemporary Modern Art of China (CMODA). An event where makers and hackers from around the world and China came together to show off their projects, do talks and lead workshops. The event was mainly organized by [Beijing Maxpace](http://www.bjmakerspace.com/) with a lead role by Justin Wang (王盛林) and the help of many students from various Chinese universities in Beijing. For the four main days of the event there was talks scheduled daily. The first day had the keynote speech, the second day I missed and supposedly not very well attended with 10 persons maximum. I participated in the Monday talks on the third day which had a sizable audience. Although the audience was mostly Chinese and many came from the general public, the talks had an international flavor to it with more than half executed in English. Speakers came from Germany, France and both coast of the USA.[![IMG_9427](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9427_thumb.jpg "IMG_9427")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9427.jpg)I kicked off the presentations with a talk about [Lophilo](http://lophilo.com/), the ARM+FPGA development board that we are developing. Lophilo found it's inception in [XinCheJian](http://xinchejian.com) so it was natural to combine both subjects. The talk started with some background about myself, how XinCheJian was created, how me and Shyu Lee met, how the idea developed for the project and what it was exactly.[![IMG_9515](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9515_thumb.jpg "IMG_9515")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9515.jpg)Jihyun Song was after me and was doing a presentation on the [Seoul Hackerspace](http://hackerspaceseoul.com/), talking about their projects, the people they have and the challenges they face. She had this video from a foreigner excited at visiting the electronics market in Seoul. This reminded me that we could do more organized visits of [our own electronics market at 668 Beijing East Road in Shanghai](http://g.co/maps/npxax).[![IMG_9536](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9536_thumb.jpg "IMG_9536")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9536.jpg)During Jihyun Song presentation, I was asked by Zhang Hao from Beijing Maxpace Hackerspace to take over the introduction of other people's presentation.[![IMG_9524](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9524_thumb.jpg "IMG_9524")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9524.jpg)The next topic was by 林欣杰 (Lin2 Xin1 Jie2) who topic was "New Media Art=Energy Conversion" with the accompanying statement: "The important element of Being new mentioned in the concept isn't the sole or even primary determinant during the art creation". As the talk was in Chinese and I was researching other following speakers, I missed some of the elements of the presentation. Tobias Schneider followed as a presenter from the [Computer Chaos Club Munich](http://muc.ccc.de/) in Germany. He was accompanied by Sophia Schillai. They talked about their electronic name badge (the "[r0ket](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/R0ket)"), how it came about and more generally about the Hackerspaces in Germany. r0ket is quite an interesting little platform and seems like a lot of fun for something started as a reusable electronic badge. One key improvement I could see is to figure out a bigger display as the name is barely visible on the current one. 刘得志 (Liu2 De2 Zhi4, Kevin) had a talk entitled "From Love to Work" translated into English as "A maker's life". He's founded an "Hackerspace" in 广州(Guang3Zhou1) called d+dimension in 2009, although I think it was never really opened to the public. He showed a very impressive "Hello Kitty Robots" interactive installation that looked quite sophisticated.[![IMG_9530](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9530_thumb.jpg "IMG_9530")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9530.jpg)[![P1000764](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000764_thumb.jpg "P1000764")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000764.jpg) [Mitch Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch%5FAltman) followed with theme common to all his talk: "do what you love". He's also inserted some interesting predictions about what he felt the global trends were. He predicts a crash of the American financial system and strongly suggested that China needed to become a creative economy.[![P1000770](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000770_thumb.jpg "P1000770")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000770.jpg)Astrida Valigorsky (Astrid) from [Wonderbred](http://www.wonderbred.com) and an active hacker at the [NYC Resistors Hackerspace](http://www.nycresistor.com/) showed up too, this time with a edible piano called a [Jeltone](http://openmaterials.org/2011/09/01/the-resistor-jeltone-an-edible-toy-piano/). Jeltone is an interactive music instruments made out of Jello and fruits. One of her key observation is that there's always some strong conflicts in developing a new idea; it’s normal and you just have to push through![![P1000771](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000771_thumb.jpg "P1000771")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000771.jpg)肖文鹏 (Xiao1Wen2Peng2, nicknamed [FlamingoEDA](http://www.flamingoeda.com)) talked about "Electronic Bricks". He's been a big driver of OpenSource and OpenHardware in China and is a co-founder of the Beijing Maxpace (which was originally called FlamingoEDA). He talked about some of the newer products and some of the innovations they have in the pipeline. 高磊 (Gao1 Lei3, nicknamed Whaleman) came out next. He's an interaction designer and CEO of [IMLAB](http://imlab.cc/) with a strong interest in the area of health. He does a lot of research into this area and has a very clear design process called Tamagome to make his own products.[![P1000772](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000772_thumb.jpg "P1000772")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000772.jpg)Greg Saul presented the OpenSource software he's working on: "[SketchChair](http://sketchchair.cc/)". Funded in large part by a very successful [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diatom/sketchchair-furniture-designed-by-you) campaign. It's a really impressive tool that allows users to design their own furniture. Not only that, but you can actually test the stability of the chair using a built-in physics model! Quite impressive and sophisticated. It's also one of my favorite subject: local and customized manufacturing. Greg finished the talk with [Piccolo](http://www.piccolo.cc/), a tiny open-source stand-alone and modifiable CNC-bot for under USD$70.[![P1000777](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000777_thumb.jpg "P1000777")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000777.jpg)Dr Garnet Hertz from UC Irvine followed. He's a [Fulbright scholar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright%5FProgram) and contemporary artist ([http://conceptlab.com](http://conceptlab.com/)). His presentation was originally scheduled to be about [Dorkbot](http://dorkbot.org/), an event for which slogan is "People doing strange things with electricity". He's one of the organizer in LA. XinCheJian has hosted two such events so far in the space and we're hoping to do more. But he decided instead to show videos from his previous projects. The first one disgusted quite a few persons in the audience as it showed a robot driven by a giant cockroach! Very cool even if the project is already a few years old. The next one was a cool retro-arcade racing game dynamically generated from the actual road. His conclusion was that having an idea is more important than the technology; we shouldn't start with Arduino or any other piece of hardware, we should start with an idea. He also did an aggressive broadside attack towards the Hackerspace Space Program, pointedly criticizing taking funds from DARPA and equating it to making weapons. I think that last one was directly addressed to me...[![P1000784](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000784_thumb.jpg "P1000784")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000784.jpg)Antonin Fourneau from [ATOCorp](http://atocorp.free.fr/) talked about HCI (Human Computer Interaction) experiments that he is doing, often modifying consoles such as Nintendo to do so. In addition, he talked about the Makerfaire-like event he's organizing in France called [ENIAROF](http://www.eniarof.com/) but with a slant towards being similar towards old-time "faire". They have a fairly complex and extensive set of rules for participants which I found interesting as a key cultural difference when compared to other hacker cultures. Devon Sean McCullough was the final presenter, but since he had left the room without explanation we decided to gather all the presenters that were still in the room and get them on a Q&A panel for the audience. It was cut short when Devon showed up later and asked to do his presentation.\[:zh\]_备注：_ _非常感谢我们微博上的热情粉丝[LolaSD](http://www.weibo.com/lolasd)帮忙将报导翻译成中文！和[谢旻琳](http://weibo.com/mlhsieh "谢旻琳")帮忙效对和放上网站！_ [![P1000580](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000580_thumb.jpg "P1000580")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000580.jpg) [创客嘉年华](http://makercarnival.com/)作为北京地区的第一个创客文化交流中心，坐落于中华世纪坛数字艺术馆（CMoDA）。来自国内外的创客聚集在一起，在创客嘉年华中展示他们的项目，发表演讲，开展工作坊活动。本次活动由王盛林带领下的[北京创客空间](http://www.bjmakerspace.com/)主办，北京各大高校的学生也积极参与，为活动提供了帮助。 为期四天的嘉年华的每天都安排了演讲分享会。第一天是大会的主题演讲，而第二天我错过了演讲，但据说来的人不是很多，不超过十个人。我参加了嘉年华第三天的周一分享会，观众的数量也大幅增加。虽然观众大部分为中国人，而且并没有创客背景，但是演讲超过一半均用英语进行，带有浓烈的国际性的色彩。演讲者主要来自德国，法国和美国的东西海岸。[![IMG_9427](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9427_thumb.jpg "IMG_9427")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9427.jpg)我以[Lophilo](http://lophilo.com/)为主题开始了第一演讲，Lophilo是一个我和李旭正在开发的一个基于ARM和FPGA的开发板。Lophilo出自于新车间创客空间，所以我很自然的将两者结合在一起。本次演讲以我自己的一些背景和经历开始，然后讲到了我和谢旻琳还有李大维共同创办新车间的过程、我和李旭如何认识、关于本项目的原始的想法和想法发展的过程。[![IMG_9515](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9515_thumb.jpg "IMG_9515")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9515.jpg)Jihyun Song在我之后发言，介绍了韩国[首尔的创客空间](http://hackerspaceseoul.com/)、韩国创客正在进行的项目、他们所拥有的人才以及所面临的挑战。她播放了一段讲述外国人在参观首尔电子市场时兴奋不已的视频，这段视频启发我们可以更频繁地组织去参观位于上海市[北京东路668号的上海赛格电子市场](http://g.co/maps/npxax)。[![IMG_9536](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9536_thumb.jpg "IMG_9536")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9536.jpg)在Jihyun Song发表演讲期间，来自北京创客空间的Zhang Hao让我接替他来做接下来的嘉宾的演讲开场介绍。[![IMG_9524](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9524_thumb.jpg "IMG_9524")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9524.jpg)演讲的下一个环节是林欣杰带来的 “新媒体=能量转换” 的主题——“在艺术创作中，新概念的提出并非是唯一甚至不是最重要的决定因素”。当时的演讲语言为中文，而我正在查看接下来的其他演讲者，所以我错过了林欣杰的演讲的一些内容。 其后，Tobias Schneider在其演讲中介绍了位于[德国慕尼黑的Chaos Communication Club](http://muc.ccc.de/)。Sophia Schillai也随同Tobias Schneider来到了现场。他们介绍了他们的电子徽章（“火箭徽章”、“[r0ket](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/R0ket)”）的来历，以及德国创客空间的情况。“火箭徽章”用可回收的电子标示牌创造而成，是一个非常有意思的微平台。我感觉如果能增加屏幕的大小将会是一个非常好的改进，现在的版本有时候连名字都看不清。 刘得志（Kevin Lau）的演讲主题是 “从爱到工作”，该主题被翻译成英语语境下的 “创客生活”。在2009年，刘创办了位于广州的 “d+dimension” 创客空间，虽然在我看来他们似乎从来没有对公众开放。期间，他展示了一个看起来很复杂的互动装置 “Hello Kitty机器猫”。[![IMG_9530](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_9530_thumb.jpg "IMG_9530")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG%5F9530.jpg)[![P1000764](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000764_thumb.jpg "P1000764")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000764.jpg) [Mitch Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch%5FAltman) 延续了以上的主题，做了主题为 “做你爱做的事” 的演讲。其中，他插入了很多他个人对世界未来潮流的非常有趣的判断。他预测了美国的金融系统崩溃的必然，而中国应该成为更有创造性的经济体。[![P1000770](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000770_thumb.jpg "P1000770")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000770.jpg)来自纽约网页设计公司[Wonderbred](http://www.wonderbred.com)的Astrida Valigorsky（Astrid）同时也是[NYC Resistors](http://www.nycresistor.com/)创客空间的一名非常活跃的创客。这次他带来一架“可以吃的钢琴”的钢琴——“[Jeltone](http://openmaterials.org/2011/09/01/the-resistor-jeltone-an-edible-toy-piano/)”。Jeltone是一个用水果和啫喱织造的互动音乐器材。她的一个重要发现是，在推进一个新想法的过程中总是有各种强烈的冲突，这是非常平常的状况，而你所需要做的便是坚持到底！[![P1000771](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000771_thumb.jpg "P1000771")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000771.jpg)肖文鹏（“[FlamingoEDA](http://www.flamingoeda.com)”）的演讲主题是“电子积木”。他是中国开源硬件的积极推动者，也是北京创客空间（原名为“FlamingoEDA”）的合作创办人之一。他介绍了一些新产品以及研发中的一些创新成果。 高磊（“Whaleman”）接着发表了演讲，他是[IMLAB](http://imlab.cc/)的一名交互设计师及CEO，并对健康医疗领域有强烈的兴趣。他在这方面做了很多研究，并且有一个称之为 “Tamagome” 的产品研发的清晰流程。[![P1000772](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000772_thumb.jpg "P1000772")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000772.jpg)Greg Saul介绍了他正在研究的开源软件“[SketchChair](http://sketchchair.cc/)”。这个软件由一个非常成功的“[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diatom/sketchchair-furniture-designed-by-you) ”项目（云集资项目）启动，是一个允许用户自主设计家具的软件，令人印象深刻。除此以外，通过内置的物理模型，你还可以运用这个软件真实测试椅子的牢固程度。这项技术非常的特别而且成熟，也是我最喜欢的主题之一：本地化和自主化的生产。Greg的演讲以“[Piccolo](http://www.piccolo.cc/)”作结，“Piccolo”是一个体积很小、独立可编辑的开源数控机床（CNC）平台。[![P1000777](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000777_thumb.jpg "P1000777")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000777.jpg)来自加州大学欧文分校的Dr Garnet Hertz也发表了演讲。他是 富布赖特项目（“[Fulbright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright%5FProgram)”）的研究人员，也是一位当代艺术家（[http://conceptlab.com](http://conceptlab.com/)）。他原始的演讲主题是关于“[Dorkbot](http://dorkbot.org/)”——“Dorkbot”是一个主题为“人类用电做奇怪的事儿”的活动，他是这个活动在洛杉矶的组织者。新车间组织过两个类似的活动而我们希望举办更多的这样的项目。但是最后他决定更改主题，展示他以往的一些项目的视频。第一个视频让好几个观众感觉反感不适，这个视频展示了一个巨型的蟑螂操作的机器人！尽管这个项目是几年前的项目，现在看起来依然非常酷。第二个视屏是关于一个非常酷的复古街机赛车游戏，其背景是由真实动态的街景路况生成。他的结论是，拥有一个想法比技术本身更重要，我们不应该从Arduino或者其他的硬件开始，我们应该从一个想法开始。他对一些创客空间计划做了尖刻的批评，尤其是从美国国防高级研究规划局（DARPA）取得资助的项目）——他认为这个制造武器无异。我认为他最后的一个批评是直接针对我而来的。。。[![P1000784](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000784_thumb.jpg "P1000784")](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/P1000784.jpg)来自[ATOCorp](http://atocorp.free.fr/) 的Antonin Fourneau谈论了他正在做的关于人机交互（HCI，Human Computer Interaction）的实验，这些实验一般通过修改例如任天堂这些游戏机完成。他也谈论了他正在法国组织的类似Makerfaire的一类的活动——[ENIAROF](http://www.eniarof.com/)，该活动与旧时代的“faire”类似。他们对参加者有相对复杂且详细的要求，这种制度比起其他的创客文化有明显的文化差异，我觉得非常有趣。 最后的演讲者是Devon Sean McCullough，但是在他毫无解释的情况下的离场之后，我们集合了所有仍然在场的演讲者完成了观众的提问环节。但是Devon Sean McCullough后来又出现了，我们让他完成演讲，所以提问环节的时间被缩短了。\[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
