 <!\[CDATA\[\[:zh\]My name is Yu Liu and I will be a rising junior at the University of Florida this coming fall. I am majoring in Electrical Engineering and I will be interning at XinCheJian from June 20th to August 14th.I hope to gain experience in electronic designs and learn as much as I can these next few weeks. As an intern here at XinCheJian, I will be keeping the space clean and organized, helping out with workshops, marketing the site, and assisting staff while also working on my own project. I will be working on an electronic skateboard project with Dooho (another intern). We were generously provided a board from Eduardo and will be trying to implement a lightweight, yet effective design. We will also be helping Eduardo out with a light sensing robot that he will be showcasing at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai. We will be learning how to build the small robot and then we will be teaching 14-18 year olds at the event. \[:en\]My name is Yu Liu and I will be a rising junior at the University of Florida this coming fall.
