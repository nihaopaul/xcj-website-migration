The first workshop "starting seedlings for hydroponic" was run by David from Urban Farming Team success this afternoon. Everyone sowed a tray of seedlings in coconut peat with variety of vegetables, including parsley, carrot, tomato, coriander and many others. On next Saturday afternoon, we will hold the 2nd mini workshop and teach you how to set up a small hydroponic system at home. \[gallery link="file" columns="1" orderby="post\_date"\]\[:zh\]迷你工作坊是新车间最新的一个让新会员能更多了解和参与不同项目的活动，各个项目会组织和项目相关的迷你工作坊。每期时长30分钟左右，向会员开放。 今天第一届迷你工作坊顺利举行。都市农耕队的工头李大维带领大家动手种下了好多蔬菜种子，并介绍了椰糠等不同的栽培介质。下周六我们将继续无土栽培的主题，教你做简易小型可以放在窗户边的水耕箱。有兴趣的会员记得来参加。 \[gallery link="file" order="DESC" columns="1" orderby="post\_date"\]\[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
