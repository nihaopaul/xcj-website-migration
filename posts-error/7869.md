Championing a method based on a combination of this material, he has helped a myriad of organizations around the world, including Y Combinator software startup SpinPunch, energy giants URS and AECOM in California and Shanghai, fast­-growing Silicon Valley money management firm Wealthfront, the Institute for Human Virology in Nigeria, Japanese health­tech startup Exmedio, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Group, and several leading universities in the US and Asia. His firm Inly works with accelerators and co-working spaces around China, helping empower startups with disruptive innovation and sustainable growth. Workshop Description Startups in China are working increasingly on new and unprecedented problems which lack their own specific best practices. As entrepreneurial innovation spreads, it becomes increasingly important to verify that demand actually exists for the new products and services being offered. In addition, because traditional research and planning are less helpful in predicting success in an environment of innovation, startup teams have wide variability in their implementation time and execution effectiveness. This workshop teaches the essentials of demand discovery for entrepreneurs and covers several tactics for efficient startup teamwork. Workshop structure 1) Startup Team Management. Nearly 2/3 startups fail for reasons related to internal conflict, and startups that adopt structured operations grow 3 times faster than competitors. Why does it help startups so much to maximize cognitive diversity in small teams? In this context, how can team members understand each other's problem-solving approach, and manage conflict productively? This part of the workshop is based on research from Stanford’s professors George Foster and Lindred Greer, Tsinghua’s professor Ning Jia, and from Y Combinator. · The difference between productive and counterproductive conflict · The difference between feelings and emotions and relevance in startup teams · Team mate fault line analysis to predict interpersonal conflict · Adopting structured systems for operations while maintaining lean flexibility 2) Demand Discovery Clearly defined startup ideas preceding market valuation have only a 0.02% chance of success. Why is it so important to focus your startup on solving a clearly defined and data-supported problem? How can you quickly and cheaply discover and validate a real problem from actual users, and which users should you focus on? This part of the workshop is based on research from Inly, search optimization guru Gerry Campbell, Mosaic coauthor Marc Andreessen, and Stanford professor Andy Rachleff. · Overview of four methods to gather useful data from potential customers · How to compile data to inform your product development direction · Essentials of search analysis and competitive analysis · The eight second rule for product validation 3) Startup founder dating We’ll end the workshop at the next door beer bar with open networking for new entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas and find cofounders. You’ll have just three minutes each, with access to our projector if you need it. Alec will be timing you, and he will be very strict about the 3-minute time limit. After the pitches, people can mingle and discuss. This workshop can help you: · Find likeminded cofounders · Overcome the challenges of internal team conflict · Effectively utilize the diversity in your team · Set lean standards for startup operation · Discover how relevant your product or service is · Obtain feedback from users and adjust your business accordingly · If you are curious about new techniques from Stanford · If you want to understand trends in global startup analysis What to expect: This workshop will be predominantly interactive. Participants will be encouraged to engage with one another to solve problems under time pressure. There will be some team building exercises and some exercises that will teach content through experiential learning. There will also be some lecture to clarify the context and to solidify the learning. Who should enroll: The workshop is for new entrepreneurs and existing startup teams. The methods taught in the workshop will help to reduce planning time and increase the likelihood of project success. All who enroll are required to bring an open mind and a willingness to actively participate.\[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
