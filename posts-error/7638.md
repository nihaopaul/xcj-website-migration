Spring Wang, Guangdong China. 2.What’s your job? Unemployment. I used to be ERP, enterprise resource planning - . Net is the tool I use to work. 3.Do you like your job? Why? I liked it in the beginning. Because I could solve other people’s problem. But now, I want to do job that is opener to the public. 4.How did you start your job? It was the first job I got after graduated from university (Nanjing), six years ago. I chose it because it needed me. 5.Your story. I majored in ecology and computer science (minor major). When the company hired me I was doing production managment. But one year later, they transferred me to IT department. When I was at high school, I learnt little bit computer. Because I was interested in computer science, I chose it as my minor major at university. 6.How did you start to learn programming? Minor major at university. 7.What project have you done? I did ERP for my computer on my own. It was a producing management software, helps company to management production better. I wish I could make it generalize. But it only suits to that industry. 8.What attracts you to the space/what do you like about the space? Two years ago, I was attracted by cars and saw XinCheJian was doing similar projects. Later on I found out that XinCheJian also hosts various workshops. I attended from time to time, because I lived little bit far. Now I’m an intern at XinCheJian because I just quitted my job and have more time. I like the open and free environment. 9.What do you want to learn at the space? I want to know what others are doing and how they are doing their projects. I want to do some contribution to XinCheJian, so I come here and hopefully will simplify some process. 10.Where would you rate yourself on a geeky slider? (or nerdy if you are that way) Five. I’m not that geeky compared to most of geekies here, but I’m geekier than normal people, so I’m at 5\. 11.How do you want the space to support you? It’s good enough now. I like events and workshops here, I hope it can keep doing it and maybe have more events. I’d like to promote more software here. 12.Do you have suggestions for people who wants to build their own projects? About programming, work on projects and looking at how others solve the problem. \[:en\][![屏幕快照 2015-11-06 下午2.45.30](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/屏幕快照-2015-11-06-下午2.45.30.png)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/屏幕快照-2015-11-06-下午2.45.30.png)1.Who are you?
