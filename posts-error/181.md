Cons:  it tends to spin on wood floors, meaning any autonomous control would need constant sensor (distance-sensing) feedback.  The motor mounts are also a bit flimsy, so the chassis isn't perfectly level. The remote needs two AA batteries (not included), so I had to buy those (6 RMB) and precision screwdrivers (25 RMB, though honestly, they're probably worth 15) late Friday night.  This was a very late-night purchase.  While charging the battery, I removed the plastic cover with the new screwdrivers, and checked the transmitter's electronics.  The transmitter is very basic, with 4 switches, a likely pulse-modulation IC, a few capacitors, and resistors. The RC transmitter design is described on [How Stuff Works](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/rc-toy2.htm).  I'm hacking it by connecting the 4 switches to each emitter pin of a ULN2803APG (8 NPN transistors) and controlling the bases with an Arduino.

 <!\[CDATA\[

I bought an [RC car from Taobao](http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=7905841099) at the extremely cheap price of 67RMB (shipping included! 10$USD!)!

For that price, you get an RC remote, a rechargeable Ni-Cd 400mAh/6V battery pack, the radio transmitter (27.145Mhz). Wheels have rubber, autonomy and range is decent although the chassis is very very cheap plastic obviously.

The downsides: on wood floor, it tends to spin so any autonomous program would need to constantly adjust based on sensor (distance ranging) input. It also has propulsion motors on a simple shock so the base isn’t totally flat with the ground.

The transmitter needed two AA batteries (not included!) so on Friday I ran out late at night to buy a pair of them (6RMB) and went on an excursion in the cold night to acquire a bunch of precision screwdrivers (25RMB, although really they’re worth 15). Pretty difficult achievement since this is after 9pm on a Friday night!

While charging the battery, I used my new screwdrivers and removed the plastic cover. I also took a look at the electronics for the transmitter. The transmitter is very simple, with 4 contact switches, what I assume is a Pulse Modulation IC, a couple of capacitors and resistances. The way an RC transmitter works is described informatively on "[How Stuff Works](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/rc-toy2.htm)".

As an hack, I hook up the four switches to each emitter pin of a ULN2803APG (a simple IC that is basically 8 NPN transistors) with the base controlled by the Arduino itself. This lets me control the car with a very simple program to test Forward, Backward, Left and Right.

The challenges ahead:

1) finding a distance ranging solutions

The robot needs to know how far walls and various objects are…

a) either IR ([Sharp IR](http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/sharp/sharp.html))

The GP2Y0A700 looks like one with the longest range, but it’s also very expensive (around 50$USD). The next one, GP2Y0A02, is about 15$USD with a range of 20cm-150cm. I probably want a bunch (3?) so I this is probably more cost effective.

b) or ultrasonic (such as the [Parallax Ping](http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=4130599681) or [SeeedStudio Ultrasonic Range Measurement module](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/ultra-sonic-range-measurement-module-p-626.html?cPath=84%5F90&zenid=93540aaf65d1a2170d41992feec85547))

c) probably a combination of them

2) need to mount the Arduino, a breadboard and the sensors on the car. This will probably require a custom aluminium plate that I can mount using the screwholes that were used for the plastic cover.

3) Figuring out how to control the motors.

Two ways;

a) remove the current control board and substitute my own. This means an H-bridge that would let me control the motors both ways (Texas Instruments L293NE or Texas Instruments SN754410)

b) create my own RC transmitter.

I’m favoring (b) right now and I went out to buy a bunch of 27.145Mhz crystals at electronics town (10RMB for 8!)
