This workshop will introduce focused use of Processing in order to simulate crowd behavior using real-time or simulated data.[登记链接](http://xinchejian.com/event2/?lang=zh&ee=189) **July 14/Motion Tracking in GRASSHOPPER:** Originally developed as a plug-in for Rhinoceros, one of the most versatile 3D NURBS modeling software in the market today, Grasshopper (GH) is a generative design tool that has been supported with a wide array of add-ons developed by an international community of programmers. During this workshop, students will have a quick introduction to the software environment of Rhino and GH and then we will focus quickly to specific add-ons developed for GH, such as Firefly to capture, translate and abstract movement using web-cam, smart-phones or Kinect into 3D geometry and visual images.[登记链接](http://xinchejian.com/event2/?lang=zh&ee=190) \[:en\][![XinCheJian_WorkshopPoster_Processing+Grasshopper](http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/XinCheJian_WorkshopPoster_Processing+Grasshopper-300x272.jpg)](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/XinCheJian%5FWorkshopPoster%5FProcessingGrasshopper.jpg)Architect & Professor **Biayna Bogosian** from Columbia University will be giving two workshops this coming weekend.**July 13/Crowd Simulation in PROCESSING:** Originally developed for computational media design and interaction education, Processing platform is arguably the easiest programming language to learn and experiment code-based digital media design.
