This workshop will introduce the focused use of Processing to simulate crowd behavior using real-time or simulated data. [Registration Link](http://xinchejian.com/event2/?lang=zh&ee=189) **July 14/Motion Tracking in GRASSHOPPER:** Originally developed as a plugin for Rhinoceros, one of the most versatile 3D NURBS modeling software in the market today, Grasshopper (GH) is a generative design tool supported by a wide array of add-ons developed by an international community of programmers. During this workshop, students will receive a quick introduction to the Rhino and GH software environments, focusing on specific add-ons such as Firefly for capturing, translating, and abstracting movement using webcams, smartphones, or Kinect into 3D geometry and visual images.
