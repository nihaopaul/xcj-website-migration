 <!\[CDATA\[Hello Xin Che Jian Members and Staff :) My name is William Kim from S. Korea. It's my honor to have an internship here at xinchejian. I am currently a high school student at The SMIC Private School English track division and going up to 12th grade next school year. I have strong interest in Computer programming and Electrical Engineering (still a noob at current stage). I have attended global events such as Intel Science Fair and GNHD. I have also made several projects using arduino, such as metal&nonmental sorting machine, a current detector that cuts off current when appliances are in standby mode in the purpose of saving the environment. I am hoping to learn lots of skills here at xinchejian and use those in my future. Always feel free to ask me for any type of assistance ( for example: translation \[ English, Korean, Chinese\]) . Thank you :)\]\]>
