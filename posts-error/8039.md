 <!\[CDATA\[My name is Kurt Lezon, and I'm a third-year Electrical Engineering student from Vanderbilt University. I'll be interning at XinCheJian from September 7th to December 9th 2016\. In addition to my responsibilities maintaining the space and helping other members, I will work on my own project. My project consists of: (1) Familiarizing myself with and setting up an [open-source toolchain](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) for the Lattice iCE40 FPGA family (2) Using this toolchain and the Lattice iCEstick board to practice developing basic designs and to validate the icestorm project (3) Applying this tool with an iCE40 FPGA to help design a biological ultrasound (4) Holding workshops to teach others how to use this toolchain with Verilog to create and implement digital designs on iCE40 FPGAs I look forward to learning from XinCheJian members and all of the amazing projects going on in this space! Feel free to contact me at kurt.j.lezon@vanderbilt.edu\]\]>
