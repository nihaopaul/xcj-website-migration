 <!\[CDATA\[_Chromaphase (aka **Matthieu Tondeur)** will be presenting this Wednesday at XinCheJian. In addition to having his own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromaphase), Matthieu is currently doing exciting 3D mapping video DJ using Mao Livehouse as his home base. Here's his self introduction:_ 

I'm a french artist-designer from Paris. I'm doing 3D mapping, VJing live show with music producers, DJ, live bands, etc...

I also worked for Huawei Mobile R&D where I lead a small innovation team makingn UI and GUI for Mobile Phones. Now I'm a freelance artist working on different projects that involve live music, art expo, interactive design and video games. (and maybe robots !! haha)

What I will speak about :

1- Introduction of myself (mon parcours)

2- What about my style of 3D mapping and live show (whole creation process) **\[Will make a live mapping demo\]**

3- Showing and explain what i did with my team in Huawei Mobile and my creative management method

4- Introduce my upcoming project and ask people that have some skill to join these projetcs

Which could lead to :

**3D mapping workshop** (A to Z creation workshop, research, process, inspiration, technical solution, etc..)

This workshop won't be too much about technical skills coz it's damn easy. But it will focus on creativity, story telling, creative content creation, innovative ways to use 3d mapping... Then we can make a small show with everyone's projects/creations. And if they are good, try to find place/gallery to show it. Content could be traditional art to processing only, depending on the interest of participants. Whatever your field, you can create something!

Here's video of one of my latest show in Guangzhou :
