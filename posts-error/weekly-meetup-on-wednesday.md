Even if it's raining, we're still hacking! Grab your umbrella and come down, put down the TV remote, or grab a TV-B-Gone kit and build it tonight from 7pm.  Access is free, so come and hang out. TheNelson is running the second part of his workshop this weekend for the upcoming roborace (http://xinchejian.com/?page_id=548&event_action=register&event_id=39&name_of_event=Roboracing%20Workshop). After a successful PCB design workshop last weekend, our new H-Bridge shields for Arduino should arrive this week, perfect for assembling and hacking on your robot for the competition at this weekend's workshop. If you don't have a cheap RC toy yet, start shopping on Taobao or come down and talk to TheNelson for some winning ideas. Michael will be around tonight - the user-controlled champion of RC toys! If you want to see how he did it and how he managed to literally \"blow the competition away\" with his tank, come see him. Michael just got back into the country, jet lag won't stop him from hacking tonight. He's bringing a new CNC mill to assemble - this will be awesome! Show your support and come to the meetup Wednesday night at 7pm at XinCheJian. Sign up and let us know you're coming (http://xinchejian.com/?page_id=548&event_action=register&event_id=40&name_of_event=Hackers%20Meetup).", "zh": null}
