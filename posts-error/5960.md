What's a night hanging out at [the pop up hackerspace in Xu Jia Hui](http://xinchejian.com/2013/09/27/pop-up-hackerspace-in-grand-gateway-mall/) without some long exposure and flash fun! Lumi and David are both long time [Strobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com) and can't pass the chance to have some fun creating ghost photos while looking after the container.

### How to make ghost photos?

The ghost photos are made with long exposure, in this case, f/20 and 5 second shutter, two flashes (one on the floor and one on the top of the container). The subjects ran into the positions, trigger the flash the manually with a remote and ran out of the frame. The flash froze the subject in place against the long exposure background and appear translucent.
