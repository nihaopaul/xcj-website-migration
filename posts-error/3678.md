 <!\[CDATA\[It's almost a month since I setup the aquaponic system in Gubei. I have learn a lot about this amazing technology and make fair amount of mistakes. But now, the plants are growing and the fishes are swimming. The system now has 5 grown carps and 10 Tilapia fingerlings and the waters are in good cycles with 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite and good amount of nitrate for plants food. This is becoming a stable aquaponic system. Now, I just have to wait for the batch of seedlings ready to transplant as well as getting a few more fish fingerlings.![DSC 8541](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC_8541.jpg "DSC_8541.JPG") ![DSC 8549](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC_8549.jpg "DSC_8549.JPG") ![DSC 8546](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC_8546.jpg "DSC_8546.JPG") ![DSC 8589](http://139.162.84.35/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC_8589.jpg "DSC_8589.JPG")\]\]>
