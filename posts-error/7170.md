This is the first time ever in XinCheJian to run Level 4 Arduino workshop. As many new makers are trying to figure out their way through all possibilities with Arduino, the majority may have only attended one or two introduction sessions to Arduino and afterwards never get the chance to continue playing with all the electronic parts and start doing fun projects. Many may have put their Arduino starter kits up on the shelf to collect dust. It that's what's happening with your Arduino kits, that would be too bad and now comes your chance to pick them up again and really get to understand everything about Arduino. This serial Arduino workshop will include all parts in the starter kits. As participants finish playing with these parts, some fun projects will be introduced to the workshop. This is a workshop that will inspire you to create and make! \[:\] \[:zh\] 周日4月5号号上午10点开始，之后连续10周，每周日上午的同一时间，新车间将举办Arduino进阶工作坊。 本次工作坊安排是应很多创客新手们的要求。对于参加过一两次Arduino入门工作坊，却一直没有时间继续深入学习的创客们来说，本次工作坊会由老师带大家一起开始把套件里的所有元器件都玩一遍，然后大家一起做好玩的小项目，把Arduino真正的玩起来！ 这也是新车间第一次举办Arduino的进阶工作坊，之前可是从来没有过的哦。不要错过这次机会。来新车间和大家愉快地玩耍吧！ \[:\]\]\]> \[:\]
