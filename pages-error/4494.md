### Quantified Self Show & Tell Event

Please register at the bottom of this page: http://xinchejian.com/event2/?ee=170Xinchejian, Thursday @ 7PM 

Are you interested in working on Quantified Self (QS) hardware or software projects? Do you have experience with biosensors or self-tracking? Welcome!

The goal of the Quantified Self group at Xinchejian is to develop new projects and continue working on existing QS projects. This can include self-tracking, biosensors, hacking existing devices or building new ones! Please feel free to join even if you don't have a project idea but are a user of self-tracking devices and you would like to share your experiences. All participants will have an opportunity to give a brief description and/or demo of their project, idea, or self-tracking experience, and we will then breakout into smaller groups based on shared interests.

This event is a co-creation of Xinchejian & Transist.

**Location:** Xinchejian - 1035 Changle Lu, 2nd floor, Near Wulumuqi Lu - 长乐路1035号2楼,近乌鲁木齐路

**What is Quantified Self? (from [QuantifiedSelf.com](http://quantifiedself.com/about/))**

Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking. We exchange information about our personal projects, the tools we use, tips we’ve gleaned, lessons we’ve learned. We blog, meet face to face, and collaborate online. There are three main “branches” to our work. \*The Quantified Self blog and community site. You are here! This is the central hub, where we keep track of all important goings-on, and you will soon be able to make connections, develop ongoing collaborations, and share detailed documentation of your personal projects. \*[Quantified Self Show&Tell meetings](http://quantified-self.meetup.com/). These are face-to-face meetings, very fun and interesting, where you can see QS projects first hand and meet QS people in your local area. The meetings started in the [San Francisco Bay Area](http://www.meetup.com/quantifiedself/), but local chapters are springing up [all over the world](http://quantified-self.meetup.com/). If there is not yet a meeting in your area, and you wish there were, you can learn how to start one by reading: [How to Start Your Own QS Show&Tell](http://quantifiedself.com/how-to-start-your-own-qs-showtell/).

## Upcoming Events

**Quantified Self Workgroup Meeting**

Xinchejian, Thursday, 3/28 @ 7PM

The goal of the Quantified Self Workgroup at Xinchejian is to develop new Quantified Self projects. This can include self-tracking, biosensors, hacking existing devices or building new software or hardware projects!

At this meeting we will hack the first prototypes of some of the self-tracking and biosensor related ideas that people brought up at the Show & Tell event (see below - I will add to the wiki soon). All are welcome to join a project team or test some ideas for a new prototype.

There are two main goals: 1) test out one or more biosensors (heart rate / brainwave / iphone app with built-in sensor) to get a feel for the data, and 2) start working on an actual prototype or demo your existing project.

Please feel free to join the Shanghai Quantified Self email list by sending a message to: [qsshanghai+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:qsshanghai%2Bsubscribe@googlegroups.com)

Also, please add your project idea to the [Xinchejian QS wiki](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Quantified%5FSelf)

and of course, <http://quantifiedself.com/> has a wealth of amazing info!!
