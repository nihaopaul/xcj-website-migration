**Quantified Self Workgroup Meeting**

Xinchejian, Thursday, 3/28 @ 7PM

The goal of the Quantified Self Workgroup at Xinchejian is to develop new Quantified Self projects. This can include self-tracking, biosensors, hacking existing devices or building new software or hardware projects!

At this meeting we will hack the first prototypes of some of the self-tracking and biosensor related ideas that people brought up at the Show & Tell event (see below - I will add to the wiki soon). All are welcome to join a project team or test some ideas for a new prototype.

There are two main goals: 1) test out one or more biosensors (heart rate / brainwave / iphone app with built-in sensor) to get a feel for the data, and 2) start working on an actual prototype or demo your existing project.

Please feel free to join the Shanghai Quantified Self email list by sending a message to: [qsshanghai+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:qsshanghai%2Bsubscribe@googlegroups.com)

Also, please add your project idea to the [Xinchejian QS wiki](http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Quantified%5FSelf)

and of course, <http://quantifiedself.com/> has a wealth of amazing info!!
