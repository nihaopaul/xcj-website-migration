Sunday, March 13th 2011 is an historic day in the world of Makerspaces worldwide as the lease for a new 100 m2 space for the first Shànghǎi Makerspace Xīnchējiān community is signed at Shànghǎi AnHuà road number 76, suite 301 in the Changníng district. We've since moved in April 2012 to a new location at the corner of Wulumuqi and Changle.
