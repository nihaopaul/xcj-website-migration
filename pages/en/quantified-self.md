Quantified Self Workgroup Meeting

Xinchejian, Thursday, March 28th @ 7PM

The goal of the Quantified Self Workgroup at Xinchejian is to develop new Quantified Self projects. This can include self-tracking, biosensors, modifying existing devices, or building new software or hardware projects.

At this meeting, we will prototype some of the self-tracking and biosensor-related ideas discussed at the Show & Tell event.  All are welcome to join a project team or experiment with new prototype ideas.

Two primary goals: 1) test various biosensors (heart rate, brainwaves, built-in iPhone sensors) to understand the data, and 2) begin working on a prototype or demonstrate an existing project.
